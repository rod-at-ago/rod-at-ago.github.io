The development process is most successful when expertise is combined in an environment where respect, communication and collaboration are embedded at every stage. In this way, the hive mind of the architect\/contractor partnership leverages the full aesthetic, technical and value potential of the project, delivering a property that is simpler to build and easier to maintain with better performance over a longer service life.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image indent\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1732\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Aberdeen-Terrace-1732x1028.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1732xX size-1732xX\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Aberdeen-Terrace-1732x1028.jpg 1732w, https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Aberdeen-Terrace-121x71.jpg 121w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1732px) 100vw, 1732px\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t\n\n\t<section class=\"news-text-images\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Rebuilding Integration Between Disciplines<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The risk of siloed teams and partisan agendas has not always been present in the construction sector.

However, the standard forms of this type of contract such as JCT<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">are structured such that the contractor\u2019s role is merely to deliver the architect\u2019s design. In reality, the dynamic between delivery partners should be much more subtle and complex than that. A contractor that delivers the architect\u2019s design without using their own knowledge and experience to put forward buildability and quality suggestions is not truly invested in the outcome of the project. Meanwhile, a construction company that makes changes to the design details or specification without prior discussion and approval from the architect is equally at risk of reducing the integrity of the finished build.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Effective collaboration is not achieved by adding a few lines to a contract. With a true collaborative approach, however, the design intent can be delivered without compromise and the potential for buildability and specification enhancements can be fully explored. The benefits to the client go beyond any cost savings typically associated with the term \u2018value engineering\u2019 because the focus is on quality and performance, ensuring vulnerable elements, such as junctions and complex details, are robust and leverage all the advantages of contemporary materials and construction techniques.<\/p>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-images\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"843\" height=\"1031\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Benton-House-843x1031.jpg\" class=\"attachment-843x1031 size-843x1031\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/figure>\n\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"843\" height=\"1031\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Aberdeen-Terrace-3-843x1031.jpg\" class=\"attachment-843x1031 size-843x1031\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/figure>\n\t\t\t<\/section>\n\t\n\n\t<section class=\"news-text\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"p1\"><b>Collaboration Starts with Communication<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, how does that collaboration work in practice? A culture of collaboration needs to be mutual and established from the outset of the project. Effective communication is critical, and this must be founded on the principle that success requires a productive partnership between the designer and the builder. While, contractually, the construction company\u2019s role is to deliver the architect\u2019s design, in truth, construction is a service not a transaction, so the relationship should be service led.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<p class=\"p1\">The architect should have an expectation that the construction team will proactively identify areas where buildability improvements can be made or building performance can be improved. The construction company, on the other hand, must be committed to offering these options for adding value aligned to the design intent and aesthetics of the project, rather than pushing for changes that will provide cost or programme advantages without improving the outcome for the client.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By establishing clear, respectful communication early in the design development and construction process, the construction team can use their knowledge and experience to consider whether there are opportunities to improve build quality and performance through simplification and standardisation. It should always be within the contractor\u2019s remit to question whether each element of the project can be done better, and a relationship built on trust between the architect and the construction team ensures those opportunities to make the finished building the best it can be are explored and exploited.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t<section class=\"news-text\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"p1\"><b>Ensuring Collaboration Thrives<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At Hale, we work hard to build relationships with architects that are characterised by communication and collaboration. Questioning construction details and interrogating specialist sub-contractors, we explore all avenues before proposing alternative solutions. It\u2019s not because we\u2019re contractually obliged to collaborate that we\u2019re proactive in making suggestions for buildability improvements, but because we\u2019re passionate about what we do. For us, that means going beyond the scope of contractual obligation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Collaboration is a two-way process, and our ability to leverage our expertise to enhance the quality, performance and longevity of the building relies just as much on the architect\u2019s management style as it does on our service ethic. Only when the architect embraces the idea that there is potential for improvement in the way the design is delivered can the finished project be improved.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ultimately, this brings us back to the goal \u2013 a successful outcome. If that\u2019s the raison d\u2019\u00eatre for all involved, and passion for making the project the best that it can be is shared and communicated, collaboration can thrive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Photography by <strong>Guy Lockwood Photography\u2060<\/strong> and <strong>Alexandria Hall Photography.<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/section>","protected":false},"author":1,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
