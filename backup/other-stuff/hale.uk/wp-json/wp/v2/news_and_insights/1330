Designed by Mullery Architects, the 6,500 square foot pavilion-style home will nestle into the sloped site. Its partially subterranean design will minimise the visual impact from the approach and maximise the dramatic views from each room.<\/p>\n<p>A green roof and the building\u2019s clean lines will further meld the property into the surrounding countryside. Terraced landscaping across the whole site will complement the natural contours of the Buckinghamshire landscape and to capitalise even more on the location, wrap-around patios will enable uninhibited indoor\/outdoor living.<\/p>\n<p>Constructed entirely from concrete, the walls will feature Insulated Concrete Formwork and the roof structure will facilitate bold cantilevered canopies. External cladding, including charred larch, steel, brick and fair-faced concrete, will additionally help blend the building into the landscape whilst delivering a modern and elegant aspect.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image indent\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1732\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/hale16-1732x1028.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1732xX size-1732xX\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t\n\n\t<section class=\"news-text\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p>Floor to ceiling windows from Compass Glass will maximise the natural light and the surrounding views. While moveable larch slatted shades combine with the roof canopies to limit thermal gain. Timber will feature inside the building as well: slatted timber ceilings and extensive wooden flooring throughout will combine to create a contemporary and natural aesthetic.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<p>The semi-subterranean lower ground floor contains a separate building with an entertainment space and facilities for the outdoor pool. A feature lift to the main living area adds the ultimate in luxury and accessible modern living. Other modern features and efficiencies across both buildings include solar panels, air conditioning and ventilation systems.<\/p>\n<p>The sloping site does present logistical construction challenges, but our experience in complex builds ensures we are well placed to overcome these.<\/p>\n<p>We are pleased to be collaborating with the other delivery partners, Adkins Consultants and Mesh M&amp;E, on this architecturally striking project. We look forward to bringing the client and architect\u2019s vision to life and sharing updates as work gets underway in October for the 15-month programme.<\/p>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image indent\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1732\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/hale17-1732x1028.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1732xX size-1732xX\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image indent\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1732\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/hale18-1732x1028.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1732xX size-1732xX\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image indent\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1732\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/hale19-1732x1028.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1732xX size-1732xX\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t","protected":false},"author":2,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
