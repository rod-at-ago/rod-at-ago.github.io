The Grade II listed building will be transformed from two apartments into a contemporary 5 storey 6-bedroom family residence.<\/p>\n<p>The project, based on plans by TFF Architects, encompasses the demolition of an existing rear extension then excavation of a new 3.5m deep, 100m<sup>2<\/sup> basement level into the sloped site. A double height rear extension will rise from the basement with open-plan kitchen and dining space on the ground floor. The lower ground floor will feature a flexible entertainment space, along with a utility and plant room.<\/p>\n<p>We will create extra space in the loft for a sixth bedroom. Additional roof lights on the existing building, along with Cantifix glazing on the rear extension and a light well, will maximise natural light entering the property.<\/p>\n<p>We will collaborate with Engineers Michael Barclay Partnership and Quantity Surveyors Cole Management on the shell and core. Working closely with the Conservation Officer for the project, we will marry Flemish bond brickwork, lime mortar and architectural details on the existing structure. While salvaging and recycling materials where possible, we will also add contemporary architecture with complementary materials.<\/p>\n<p>Hale Managing Director Christian Hale said: \u201cWe are looking forward to collaborating with the team and delivering a quality and sympathetic restoration and extension of this listed family home.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHale brings extensive experience with listed buildings, and we will take great care to preserve the Arts and Crafts\u2019 architectural details of the property during the structural renovation works.&#8221;<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/section>","protected":false},"author":2,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
