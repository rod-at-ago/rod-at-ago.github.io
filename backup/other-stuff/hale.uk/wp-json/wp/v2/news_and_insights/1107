The project also includes refurbishment of all existing accommodation and external works comprising hard landscaping, a new driveway and a garden office.<\/p>\n<p>The project combines traditional aesthetics and materials in the original Victorian property, including herringbone flooring, wall panelling, and architraves, with contemporary features such as shadow gaps, polished concrete floors and crittall glazing in the extensions. In this way, the architect has designed a refurbishment that maintains the integrity of the existing property while upgrading it for modern lifestyles and tastes.<\/p>\n<p>All fixtures and finishes will be of an extremely high quality, with a wine cellar in the basement, Salvatori designer Italian tiling in the master bathroom suite, air conditioning in the bedrooms, lighting controls and A\/V system throughout, and an air source heat pump to power the underfloor heating.<\/p>\n<p>The client\u2019s brief was to ensure that the acoustic design and specification of the property was of particular importance, not just to minimise the external noise of city life but also to reduce the echo from the hard surface finishes of the internal contemporary detailing. Acoustic consultant, KP Acoustics, has been responsible for advising on the project\u2019s acoustic specification, which includes a trench that will be excavated along the inside length of the front wall to limit vibration from buses and reduce traffic noise from the main road location. Meanwhile in the rear extension, a BASWA acoustic system, fabricated using laminated composite layers of hemp and recycled materials, will be installed to create the ceiling. The refurbishment also includes the installation of acoustic glazing.<\/p>\n<p>The project also provides an opportunity to work with Symmetrys, the structural engineers, again, and Carnell Warren who will be responsible for the M&amp;E.<\/p>\n<p>Director, Christian Hale, comments: \u201cThis project will refresh the traditional property while delivering exciting new spaces that both complement and juxtapose the existing. The acoustic element is an interesting addition to the buildability requirements, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing how these solutions manage the effects of sound in the finished build.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/section>","protected":false},"author":2,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
