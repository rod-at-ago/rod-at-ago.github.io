Due to start on site in March this year for a 52-week programme, the property will combine traditional forms and materials, including a pitched roof and brick facades, with a steel frame and extensive glazing, creating a Scandi-inspired family home.<\/p>\n<p>The 6000sq ft home will comprise ground, first and eaves level accommodation, overlooking a hard-landscaped terrace, which the Hale team will deliver, and a garden beyond.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image indent\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1732\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/HaleNew-1732x1028.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1732xX size-1732xX\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/HaleNew-1732x1028.jpg 1732w, https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/HaleNew-121x71.jpg 121w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1732px) 100vw, 1732px\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t\n\n\t<section class=\"news-text\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p>While the materials and layout of the property will be conventional, the detail, interiors and building services will be contemporary.<\/p>\n<p>The brick facades will be constructed using Danish Randers Tegl bricks, which are twice as long as standard bricks and just 38mm high, giving the property a distinctive aesthetic and texture. The design focuses on simple forms and clean lines, requiring meticulous attention to detail in the construction. This includes a double-height glazed entrance and floor to ceiling windows with no window bars, along with concealed gutters.<\/p>\n<p>Solar PV panels will be set into the roof and the property will also combine a mechanical heat recovery ventilation system for energy efficient heating and cooling, with underfloor heating throughout and an extremely airtight, thermally efficient building envelope.<\/p>\n<p>Internally, the Hale team will finish the property to a very high standard and install extensive A\/V systems and smart home technology for comfort, controllability and energy efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Christian Hale, director of Hale commented: \u201cWe are delighted to be working with an architectural practice that we\u2019ve never worked with before on this project in Esher that balances traditional forms with contemporary details. The project will showcase our ability to deliver unique homes to a very high standard and manage a complex programme while minimising disruption for neighbouring residents.\u201d<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/section>","protected":false},"author":2,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
