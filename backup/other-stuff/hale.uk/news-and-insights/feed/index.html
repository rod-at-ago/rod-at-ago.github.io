				<h1>Are We All Stuck on a Hamster Wheel of Value Engineering?</h1>
		<div>
			<p class="p1">We’re seeing an increasing trend of post tender ‘value engineering’ requests requiring 25% or more in cost savings. Tender authorities are telling us that all the tender prices they receive (not just from us) are 30% more than they expected. At Hale, we pride ourselves on maximising value and maintaining lasting quality, but finding a 25-30% saving at the build stage demands significantly more than a practical building approach or specification tweaks! It essentially means going back to the drawing board. Changing scope, design details, specifications and pricing documents, and potentially going back to planning. All of which leads to significant delays.</p>
<p class="p1">To put things into perspective, of the tender requests we received over the 2023-2024 tax year, clients abandoned 20% of planned projects or put them on hold entirely following tender submissions. And we lost another 20% of estimated works through cost savings. That means only 60% of works we estimated went ahead, a much lower figure than any previous year.</p>
<p class="p1">Cost saving exercises aren’t new, we regularly see 10% variations in tender prices. But 30% difference is exceptional. From our experience, it takes between 2 and 5 years after a client receives initial design concepts before we get tender requests. We’re costing projects today which started out when inflation wasn’t a significant factor, unlike today where 20% is included in most budgets. Because of these rising prices, it’s more important than ever to keep abreast of project costs and managing client budget expectations, so a Quantity Surveyor is pivotal. It’s important for designers to take clients on a creative journey from their initial brief, but it’s equally important that clients’ budget expectations follow this journey so the quote isn’t a shock.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Budget v Time Conundrum</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Not understanding the budget until after the tender stage can have hugely detrimental effects. We’re not the only ones witnessing projects being abandoned because of budgets. It’s frustrating for everyone involved and can dash clients’ dreams just as they’re about to break ground.</p>
<p class="p1">Revising and re-costing projects after the tender process demands a lot of work from everyone involved. Here’s a simple summary of the complexities:</p>
<p class="p2">Design team, QS and contractors go through the project plans together and create a ‘shopping list’ of potential ways to save money. It’s often practical versus aesthetic, with compromises along the way. Anything from fewer windows to a smaller basement will be up for debate.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>&#8211; Contractors provide indicative/broad estimates of savings</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>&#8211; Client team agrees the ‘reduced’ shopping list in principle.</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>&#8211; Design team updates all the tender information (including all drawings and specialist subcontractor information).</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Contractors produce revised formal tender pricing.</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Client agrees and we all finalise contracts.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">From our experience, to be done properly, this takes a minimum of three months and considerably more if the project needs to be resubmitted to planning. The process sucks up significant time and resources, not just from contractors and sub-contractors, but also with design teams. Time which clients are usually unwilling to pay for.</p>
<p class="p1">Any potential cost savings can be cancelled out if the project is resubmitted for planning approval. Further price rises during the planning process can completely defeat the purpose of the process and result in a client getting far less than they originally wanted, for the same price.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Preventing Budget Problems in the First Place</strong></p>
<p class="p1">To avoid these lengthy and frustrating cost saving exercises post tender, it’s vital to engage specialist suppliers and cost consultants to produce realistic cost plans early on and for them to be regularly updated. Clients may question the value of this and will be eager to issue a tender, but they need to understand the delays and potential costs associated with issuing tenders which they subsequently don’t have the financial appetite for.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are some effective ways we’ve found for preventing financial surprises and maintaining a client’s vision:</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Collaboration between architects, designers and quantity surveyors can address the budget challenge and better manage client expectations. Developing robust cost plans with cost consultants and quantity surveyors at the early stages of a project is essential. From their expertise and experience, they can more accurately account for potential market changes. This saves time for everyone involved.</p>
<p><strong>Regular Reviews</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It’s also critical to regularly review costs with all parties to give clients a clear and realistic understanding of the project&#8217;s financial implications. Again, this reduces the likelihood of lengthy and cost saving exercises later.</p>
<p><strong>A Pared-down Tender Process</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We also recommend a stripped back tender process to cost the project as a plastered shell with M&amp;E. This saves time for the design team and clients, as well as the contractors, so tender requests can be issued earlier, and more accurate prices received quicker.</p>
<p class="p1">Although very time consuming to finalise every design detail and for the contractor to price accurately, finishes and FF&amp;E budgets are relatively easy to define. Budget allocation for these items can then be fine-tuned depending on the costs of the tendered build (shell and M&amp;E).</p>
<p><strong>Awareness and Education</strong></p>
<p class="p1">To produce the best customer experience and design brilliance (the true essence of value engineering), design teams must understand the cost implications of their decisions more deeply. By fostering this awareness, designers can be pragmatic about budgets, value engineering and collaboration. Only then can they better identify opportunities to optimise value for the client’s available budget and project without compromising the overall design intent.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We shouldn’t be seeing so many luxury home projects being derailed by poor budget management, lengthy delays and frustrations. By better understanding costs and/or engaging cost consultants early and doing thorough due diligence on pricing, it&#8217;s possible to proactively manage client budgets and expectations. A revised tendering process can help avoid scary late-stage financial surprises.</p>
<p class="p1">As experienced fine builders, Hale understands the importance of protecting the client&#8217;s overall vision while making informed value recommendations. Our goal, as yours, is delivering an outstanding project that brings the client&#8217;s dreams to life within their financial parameters, in the most positive and effective way.</p>

				<h1><strong>Hale wins bid to enhance listed Hampstead home</strong></h1>
		<div>
			<p>Furthering our experience refurbishing and developing listed buildings, we have won the phase 1 contract to restore and extend a 1909 semi-detached home in Hampstead. The Grade II listed building will be transformed from two apartments into a contemporary 5 storey 6-bedroom family residence.</p>
<p>The project, based on plans by TFF Architects, encompasses the demolition of an existing rear extension then excavation of a new 3.5m deep, 100m<sup>2</sup> basement level into the sloped site. A double height rear extension will rise from the basement with open-plan kitchen and dining space on the ground floor. The lower ground floor will feature a flexible entertainment space, along with a utility and plant room.</p>
<p>We will create extra space in the loft for a sixth bedroom. Additional roof lights on the existing building, along with Cantifix glazing on the rear extension and a light well, will maximise natural light entering the property.</p>
<p>We will collaborate with Engineers Michael Barclay Partnership and Quantity Surveyors Cole Management on the shell and core. Working closely with the Conservation Officer for the project, we will marry Flemish bond brickwork, lime mortar and architectural details on the existing structure. While salvaging and recycling materials where possible, we will also add contemporary architecture with complementary materials.</p>
<p>Hale Managing Director Christian Hale said: “We are looking forward to collaborating with the team and delivering a quality and sympathetic restoration and extension of this listed family home.</p>
<p>“Hale brings extensive experience with listed buildings, and we will take great care to preserve the Arts and Crafts’ architectural details of the property during the structural renovation works.&#8221;</p>

				<h1><strong>Hale completes luxury family home in Esher, Surrey</strong></h1>
		<div>
			<p>Hale has completed an exquisite contemporary family home in Surrey. It was our first project collaborating with award-winning architects Holland Green Architecture and deepens our experience in the luxury homes sector. From foundations and hard landscaping to final fix, we managed the entire 52-week programme and have delivered an outstanding home which is creating an impact in the luxury homes sector.</p>
<p>The high-end design mixes traditional forms and materials with contemporary flair. A steel frame facilitates three floors of accommodation and extensive glazing to maximise the light and space across 6,000 square feet.</p>
<p>We built the property using Randers Tegl Ultima bricks for an outstanding contemporary impact across the entire exterior. Only 38mm high but twice as long as standard, each brick had to be laid with particular care, using carefully selected coloured mortar from Tarmac, to complement the grey tones of the bricks. The huge sections of glazing were logistically and technically complex to install, but the effect is stunning. With no supporting bars, the family can enjoy uninterrupted garden views.</p>

				<div>
			<p>We installed large roof lights on the pitched roof, along with an 8kW solar array to further capitalise on sunlight all year round. The wraparound terrace will come into its own during the summer months as the family enjoys outdoor-indoor living.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The owners wanted to avoid traditional fuels, so alongside the solar panels, we fitted a 12kW Air Source Heat Pump. This not only provides hot water and underfloor heating, but chilled water for the air conditioning system too.</p>
<p>A mechanical heat recovery ventilation system was added for even greater comfort and air circulation. Overall, we established an airtight building envelope to ensure the best performance and thermal efficiency.</p>
<p>We also connected storage batteries to the solar panels to power the family’s electric vehicles and lower their demands on the electricity grid. Alongside the contemporary energy system, we installed a complex electrical scheme with integrated smart technology to manage security, lighting, entertainment and heating.</p>
<p>The impressive, triple-height entrance hallway to the property features a floating steel and smoked oak staircase with glass balustrades and LED tread lights and is topped with an exquisite light fixture of multiple individual hanging pieces. The herringbone smoked oak engineered flooring from Ted Todd runs throughout the ground floor.</p>
<p>The success of the light-filled space and interior design of the home hinges on clean lines, a minimal palette of materials and the impeccable finish we implemented. Fine details such as concealed gutters, glass balustrades, elegant bathrooms and the custom-built Neatsmith dressing room add to the overall impression of simplicity and quiet luxury.</p>
<p>Christian Hale, Managing Director of Hale, said: “We’ve thoroughly enjoyed working with HollandGreen. Our companies share a collaborative and proactive ethos over design and construction, which has culminated in us producing an exceptional home in every way. The project showcases our ability to deliver unique homes to a very high standard and manage a complex programme. A design like this demands genuine care and attention. The skill, quality and meticulous detail we’ve poured into this project has made it the success it is. I’m so proud of the team’s enthusiasm, dedication and achievements in bringing this family’s dream home to life.”</p>

				<h1><strong>Hale selected for striking hillside home in Buckinghamshire</strong></h1>
		<div>
			<p>We are pleased to announce we have won an exciting contemporary residential project in Buckinghamshire. Designed by Mullery Architects, the 6,500 square foot pavilion-style home will nestle into the sloped site. Its partially subterranean design will minimise the visual impact from the approach and maximise the dramatic views from each room.</p>
<p>A green roof and the building’s clean lines will further meld the property into the surrounding countryside. Terraced landscaping across the whole site will complement the natural contours of the Buckinghamshire landscape and to capitalise even more on the location, wrap-around patios will enable uninhibited indoor/outdoor living.</p>
<p>Constructed entirely from concrete, the walls will feature Insulated Concrete Formwork and the roof structure will facilitate bold cantilevered canopies. External cladding, including charred larch, steel, brick and fair-faced concrete, will additionally help blend the building into the landscape whilst delivering a modern and elegant aspect.</p>
		</div>

			<p>Floor to ceiling windows from Compass Glass will maximise the natural light and the surrounding views. While moveable larch slatted shades combine with the roof canopies to limit thermal gain. Timber will feature inside the building as well: slatted timber ceilings and extensive wooden flooring throughout will combine to create a contemporary and natural aesthetic.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The semi-subterranean lower ground floor contains a separate building with an entertainment space and facilities for the outdoor pool. A feature lift to the main living area adds the ultimate in luxury and accessible modern living. Other modern features and efficiencies across both buildings include solar panels, air conditioning and ventilation systems.</p>
<p>The sloping site does present logistical construction challenges, but our experience in complex builds ensures we are well placed to overcome these.</p>
<p>We are pleased to be collaborating with the other delivery partners, Adkins Consultants and Mesh M&amp;E, on this architecturally striking project. We look forward to bringing the client and architect’s vision to life and sharing updates as work gets underway in October for the 15-month programme.</p>

				<h1><strong>Considering cost, carbon and construction: making refurbishment more viable.</strong></h1>
		<div>
			<p>The construction industry is caught in a predicament. There’s an urgent need to reduce carbon and environmental impact, but our ageing housing stock desperately needs modernisation as homes fail to meet modern standards of living.</p>
<p>However, the zero VAT rule for new builds, to help address the housing shortage, is incentivising people to demolish properties and start afresh to make the construction process and building itself more efficient – in terms of finance, time and energy.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, up to 50,000 buildings are being knocked down each year in the UK to make way for new ones. This isn’t necessarily because they are structurally unsafe, but because it is cheaper and more efficient to demolish and rebuild. However, as a result, there is more embodied carbon being produced.</p>
<p>We have fewer than 30 years to decarbonise buildings and reach the Net Zero target in 2050, so we need some radical changes today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grade III – protection or prohibition?</strong></p>
<p>One radical suggestion for a new Grade III listed building status to protect sound buildings from being demolished is being backed by Kevin McCloud. While this proposal may seem like a good idea, it could be a vanity project for everyday developers and construction teams.</p>
<p>Grade III listing would instantly devalue a property thanks to the associated bureaucracy and limitations for improvement or modernisation. Regulation like this often leads to unintended negative consequences and may lose sight of the goal to reduce carbon emissions, as modern efficiency measures could be overlooked in preference of preservation. But there is hope for listed buildings becoming more efficient: momentously, Ledston Hall became the first Grade I-listed property to have permission to install double-glazed windows in April 2023. Public perception of the limitations when renovating and improving efficiencies of a listed building could deter potential owners or investors, and ultimately defeat the intention of preserving cultural and historical architecture, as they could be left badly maintained or unoccupied.</p>
<p>The original Grade III idea was muted by structural engineer and writer Will Arnold in November 2022. He wants to prevent ‘sound’ buildings being demolished for new: “The property may only be demolished if it is structurally unsafe or is given special dispensation by the local planning authority.” But that also opens a debate about how you define a ‘sound’ building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, what’s the sustainable solution?</strong></p>
<p>The industry and government need to encourage the reuse, redevelopment and refurbishment of all properties. And currently, the zero VAT financial incentive for new builds is preventing any progress.</p>
<p>As refurbishments or renovations are 20% VAT applicable, there’s a huge incentive to rebuild instead. New builds also benefit from a reduced risk of spiralling costs and delays, with fewer surprises than a renovation and refurbishment. Sometimes it simply isn’t cost-effective, safe, or efficient to refurbish a property.</p>
<p>If the VAT incentive for new builds was removed or another financial incentive introduced for renovation to outweigh the zero VAT savings, the equation would be more balanced.</p>

				<div>
			<p><strong>If you don’t measure it, you can’t manage it </strong></p>
<p>Current environmental requirements for Building Control through EPC and SAP focus entirely on the operational efficiencies of the building once construction is complete. A better perspective is to assess the whole-life carbon of the building, from construction through to demolition.</p>
<p>The London Plan, RICS and Berkeley Homes all have active whole-life carbon assessment programmes measuring the real impact of a building from inception to demise. With a better grasp of whole-life carbon levels, we can all see where potential savings can be made and find innovative ways to change behaviours and reduce carbon.</p>
<p>With nationwide schemes to actively monitor and reduce lifetime carbon for all properties, there would be a greater drive for more innovative tools to provide quicker and easier carbon measurement to encourage more sustainable building practices. Products like Cercula calculate the embodied carbon from a bill of quantities, so there are tools out there. But unless the government introduces mandatory reductions, I fear the industry will avoid these monitoring processes, as cost is the primary driver.</p>
<p>A funding scheme to pay back the demonstrable carbon difference between the whole-life carbon of a new build compared to the whole-life carbon of the planned remedial work could be introduced. Or maybe add a square metre whole-life carbon limit for all buildings. Combined, these measures encourage and enable a developer to easily weigh up the cost benefit of using existing materials and practices against more sustainable materials and methods of construction.</p>
<p>Whatever the solution, it shouldn’t be just about offsetting whole-life carbon like the current trend reflects. This approach is open to manipulation and pushes the problem further down the line. The clock is ticking on the 2050 deadline, so cultural change needs to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How we approach it</strong></p>
<p>At Hale, we have always focused on the whole-life of a building, favouring quality, longevity and performance, above concentrating solely on the construction process. We work with carefully selected partners and suppliers and often have the opportunity to help shape the consideration of sustainable practices. However, many construction firms don’t have that luxury and simply respond to the determined programme.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the key to a sustainable approach in construction lies in finding a balance between preserving our architecture, reducing our carbon impact, removing the cost barrier, and meeting the demands of modern life. An approach that we’re passionate about and will continue to develop; establishing new and innovative ways to add value.</p>

				<h1>Achieving our exacting standards with quality construction management</h1>
		<div>
			<p>We’re often asked why we’re so good at what we do. The simple answer &#8211; we produce consistently fine buildings. But that doesn’t explain a lot. Many claim they’re high-quality or fine builders. The much more interesting and important question is, <em>how</em> are we so good at what we do?</p>
<p>‘How’, is the crux of our success and at the heart of our business values – quality.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re a Michelin trained chef. You’re asked to cook at a pop-up restaurant. They ask you to cook a summer feast for 200 people using an outdoor kitchen and they agree to your rate. You arrive at the address supplied ready to flex your foodie muscles and tantalise tastebuds, armed with a van loaded with the finest and freshest seasonal produce. You’re shown to a kitchen with a grubby little fridge, gas powered griddle and smelly deep-fat fryer. You turn your furrowed brow to the owner, who says, ‘We’re catering for 150 meat eaters and 50 vegans. The buns need to be gluten-free and the burgers will be £8.00 with onions and cheese. Fred’s going to supervise everything.’ You have two choices: abandon the job entirely or lower your standards and get the job done as quickly and painlessly as you can.</p>
<p>The moral of this story? Even someone with the highest skills and best experience needs the right environment, management and clearly defined outcomes, otherwise they are unlikely to complete the job. Or they will be forced to cut corners which will jeopardise quality.</p>
<p><strong>What is quality?</strong></p>
<p>Many companies fail in their pursuit of quality because they fall at the first hurdle. To produce ‘high-quality’, you have to define what quality is. And some of those that claim quality often don’t communicate it – clearly enough, early enough or to each trade.</p>
<p>At Hale, we define quality for all members of the construction team and every subcontractor. We share our exacting standards with concise details for each trade, so everyone knows what to expect, can knowingly perform their duties and ultimately take collective responsibility for excellence. This standardised process is only one part of our construction management system, but it’s vital. It ensures we get the most from our subcontractors and produce consistently fine buildings because we can effectively review progress and quality at every stage.</p>
<p>And we mean every stage! Quality management starts with procurement. Our Contract Managers and Quantity Surveyors will produce meticulous tender packs which include everything from Health and Safety information to the Statement of Works and Quality Assurance sheets for each trade.</p>
<p>When dealing with high-end architecture and luxury specifications, the expectations are understandably higher. British Standards are too generic and open to interpretation, so we’ve developed our own specific and detailed quality assurance methods, which we’ve fastidiously refined over our careers, far exceeding ‘off-the-shelf’ guidance; and they’re free from jargon so each trade can easily understand them. Genuine quality is doing things to the highest standards and doing it once. Rectifying problems or sub-standard work can be costly in terms of time and expense, and there could be longer-term defects. That’s why we motivate everyone to do things right, first time, instead of supplying a long list of defects after the event. We can only achieve that goal with clearly defined quality standards.</p>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section class="news-text-images" data-colour="light">
				<div>
			<p><strong>Quality control</strong></p>
<p>Our Quality Assurance sheets include every specification and tolerance for each element. For example, when plastering over a three-metre span, we place a rule along the entire length and if there’s more than a two millimetre deviation, we will not mark it as complete or satisfactory. By defining quality so clearly with specific details, and at the pricing stage, it means everyone is more efficient (financially and physically), they can budget, schedule and complete as necessary.</p>
<p>Every one of our projects is bespoke, but we standardise all processes to help us achieve the same high standards. We’ve developed our method from nuanced and expert observation and use an accessible Construction Management System (CMS) to help programmes run as smoothly as possible. It isn’t about ticking boxes or hanging a certificate on the wall, it’s essential in achieving lasting quality.</p>
<p><strong>Quality communication</strong></p>
<p>Our CMS allows us to communicate and monitor quality clearly, helping us to utilise subcontractors’ skills, time and resources in the best possible way. Simply put, we get the most out of them, helping them to be their best.</p>
<p>To be at their best, everyone needs to have the correct information, and that goes both ways. Each individual involved in construction has their own areas of expertise, but we shouldn’t assume everyone else understands what we need. For example, instead of merely asking architects for the latest bathroom drawing, we’ll clearly state what we need: ‘scale drawings of 1:20 for each bathroom, showing each elevation with plumbing, Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning, electrics, sanitary ware and fittings clearly marked’. Missing information can lead to confusion, educated guesses or lost time. With crystal clear instructions, we make sure we complete the job once and to a high standard, preventing any loss of time, resource, materials or subsequent snagging.</p>
<p><strong>Quality from the start</strong></p>
<p>Quality needs to be everywhere: below and above the ground, for every trade, at every stage. There’s no point having the finest of finishes if the structure is substandard. From a pre-works checklist to make sure everyone and everything is prepared and in place before any work starts on site, to weekly site management checklists and handover assessments, our robust and standardised management process ensures we deliver consistently fine buildings, efficiently and collaboratively. And it helps us develop great working partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>A revelation</strong></p>
<p>Construction is a complex beast and for successful and high-quality completion, each subcontractor, invested party and building phase must be carefully and efficiently managed. That’s our secret. That’s <em>how</em> we’re so good at what we do. Our defined quality standards and detailed management process enable everyone to do their jobs to their best ability. We provide outstanding service and proudly create impressive buildings that epitomise quality in every detail. And we will continue to review and refine so we can exceed expectations wherever possible.</p>

				<h1>Building Control – what’s the point if they aren’t accountable?</h1>
		<div>
			<p>It may be news to some that Building Control isn’t ultimately accountable for ensuring that a completed building complies with building regulations. Their role must be, therefore, simply to advise and assist the client to meet the standards. The current process is failing to find anyone with legal liability so, is the whole process even worthwhile? How can Building Control expect to improve standards and apply regulation if they have no legal accountability? Where can we innovate to improve standards?</p>
<p>Since privatisation in 1997, we’ve noticed gradual changes in the Building Control process and their service. And now we’re witnessing issues with the Building Control process with increasing frequency and levels of frustration.</p>
<p>At Hale, we engage with Building Control Bodies (BCBs) at all stages, not only to meet minimum requirements but to look for improvements to add value for our clients and to fulfil our mission to build lasting quality and ensure the wellbeing of our end users.</p>
<p>We firmly believe the end goal for everyone in the construction industry should be to erect a building to a high standard and ensure it lasts a long time. However, the way regulations are currently enforced means that the goal has shifted, with some viewing the regulations as a guide which can be manipulated as required to save costs. The only innovation this drives is developing more cunning ways to ‘get round’ the regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Recent misgivings</strong></p>
<p>The industry is still reeling from the Grenfell disaster and as the inquiry continues, we aren’t any further forward. The situation highlighted the very issue of accountability that has been developing for a long time. But why is attention merely focused on high-rise buildings? The same problem exists across the industry and for all types of building areas of safety, sustainability and comfort should be considered within the Building Control and regulatory process.</p>
<p>In theory, it should be a simple procedure – BCBs approve detailed drawings, then site visits confirm that the physical result matches the drawings. However, we’re witnessing tremendous levels of disparity between BCBs and their inspectors: some are much more lenient than others, there’s substantial variation in interpreting regulation, and they limit site visits. We’ve requested site inspections a few times to check progress, or incremental changes to drawings following on-site mitigation work, and the BCB has refused to visit as it was out of their allotted spend.</p>
<p>In another dramatic example, we recently took over a project (following insolvency of the previous contractor) with Building Control certified shell and core, yet there were major defects in the new structure that was handed over. We worked closely with architects, structural engineers and the BCB to remedy the work and ensure a safe build for the client, but they had to invest extra money to do so. The client was placed in a risky position they never should have been in.</p>
<p>We fully appreciate that as commercial enterprises BCBs have to perform as efficiently as they can, not only to keep afloat but to make a profit &#8211; but they must uphold standards. It appears that as they don’t have ultimate responsibility for the end results, profit margins are more important, leaving the building owner at risk, despite having paid for and gained Building Control approval.</p>
<p><strong>Privatisation creating too much commercial choice and manipulation</strong></p>
<p>Since privatisation, end users or developers can choose their own BCB instead of being allocated a Local Authority inspector. The market has grown significantly in recent years, leading to extensive competition, which is good and generally drives innovation and efficiency. However, as James King, president of the London District Surveyors Association (LDSA) pointed out in his letter to the Hackitt review back in 2018:</p>
<p>“It becomes extremely easy for the ‘regulated person’ to apply financial and commercial pressure to the person who is supposed to be upholding the standards. No other sphere of activity is regulated in this way…I don’t think anyone would countenance a restaurant employing their own food hygiene inspector.”</p>
<p>We’ve experienced BCBs offering discounted work to secure further contracts. We even have anecdotal evidence of inspectors certifying sub-standard works in a quid pro quo situation to guarantee future income.</p>
<p><strong>Current options not quite cutting it</strong></p>
<p>Build Warranty programmes, like the NHBC scheme for new builds, seem to work well. NHBC is widely recognised and provides warranties for 80% of new homes. But do warranty schemes offer sufficient cover? Apart from being a mortgage pre-requisite, they’re all voluntary schemes, and are only for new builds, often with costs that can alienate many private construction projects, therefore they fail in their goal of driving up quality across the industry. Without universal standards, warranty providers are racing to the bottom to provide the least amount of cover, making the paper it’s printed on the only enduring element of the agreement.</p>
<p><strong>A radical rethink</strong></p>
<p>As Dame Judith Hackitt identified in her review, if you set minimum standards, they may well be the maximum you ever get:</p>
<p>“Some of those who construct buildings treat the minimum standards in the Approved Documents as a high bar to be negotiated down, rather than genuinely owning the principles of a safe building and meeting the outcomes set out in regulations…There is a need for a radical rethink of the whole system and how it works.”</p>
<p>Solving this issue demands a complex and long-term process, but we believe there are some actions which will help: collaboration, regulation and mandatory obligation.</p>
<p>Clients often want the cheapest option but demand the best. Extending Building Control approval to provide an NHBC style warranty set to minimum requirements could be the most efficient, fair and serviceable solution for all. BCBs will then perform a key role in driving up standards across the industry driven by the demands of warranty underwriters.</p>
<p>The process, including warranties, will be more expensive for the client but the finished product will be built to a higher standard with guarantees for current and future building owners. By encompassing a warranty system, relationships between builders and the providers will have to be closer and more collaborative, and ultimately encourage innovation from all parties to efficiently meet the goal of high-quality and enduring buildings. This already happens with NHBC where some NHBC standards exceed the Building Control requirements.</p>
<p>As a result, buildings will last longer, be more efficient and have reduced lifetime costs. Regulation would ensure minimum standards of warranty cover and competition will then drive efficiency to make it more cost-effective longer-term.</p>
<p>A tiered accreditation scheme similar to BREEAM may provide even more incentive to achieve higher standards and improve the entire construction industry. Higher ratings could garner higher confidence, assurances, and ultimately higher resale prices and profits, to reward and encourage everyone in the building community to innovate and strive for better.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The system needs substantial improvements, but we believe accountability is possible. It will need an investment of time, resource and expertise to do properly, calling on all areas of the building community. We’ll eagerly await the changes, but in the meantime, we will continue striving for the highest standards in our own work, working closely and collaboratively with the client team, architects, developers and owners.</p>
<p>We’re a committed construction company, never compromise and always want to do the best possible job. Some people will always try to exploit the system but you can rest assured that at Hale we create enduring quality. For us, it’s more than ticking the boxes and making things aesthetically pleasing for handover, it’s constructing something we’re proud of and that the owner can enjoy for generations &#8211; with lasting quality and functionality.</p>

				<h1>Bigger, finer, but no less attention to detail for Hale in 2022</h1>
		<div>
			<p>This year has seen us step up the size of projects we’ve won at Hale and work with architects that we have admired and wanted to work with for some time.</p>
<p><strong>Two exclusive Surrey new builds</strong></p>
<p>In the spring we secured two new build contracts in the Surrey countryside. The first, with international architectural practice, Ascot Design, is the largest private home we have constructed to date: a 9000 sq ft plot with 400 sq m of glazing, an open plan layout and contemporary finishes. Alongside garages to accommodate multiple vehicles and an outdoor swimming pool, the property will also include a basketball court and dedicated golf simulation room.</p>
<p>Our second Surrey new build project secured in the first quarter of 2022 is for a Scandi-inspired home designed by award winning architects, interior design and landscaping experts HollandGreen – another new architect relationship for us. With an emphasis on clean, modern lines and contemporary details, the 6,000 ft property incorporates several sustainable features including solar PV panels, smart home technology and an airtight, thermally efficient building envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Attention to all details</strong></p>
<p>This year has seen us continue our attention on the fine details of luxury building projects, not just the aesthetically eye catching and glamourous, but also the seemingly mundane and discreet. Adopting a fabric first approach using insulation and airtightness to prevent energy loss, and installing heat recovery ventilation systems for adequate ventilation, is our preferred approach for energy efficiency and wellbeing for the homeowner. It’s one we are keen to stress as more important – and fundamentally more successful – than attention-grabbing ‘bells and whistles’ such as ground source heat pumps.</p>
<p>With the desire to include many contemporary hard surfaces in the home – from polished concrete floors to kitchen work tops – acoustics has also become an important focus in the design process of new builds and refurbishment projects, particularly those located in the city.</p>
<p>For the refurbishment and extension project in Ealing that we acquired in the summer, we are working with acoustics specialists to minimise external noise by excavating the inside length of the front wall to limit vibration from buses and reduce traffic noise from the main road location. Meanwhile, in the rear extension to the property, we are installing a BASWA acoustic system, fabricated using laminated composite layers of hemp and recycled materials, to create the sound-absorbent ceiling. The refurbishment also includes the installation of acoustic glazing.</p>
<p>Although such features don’t have the same ‘wow factor’ as the spiral wine cellars, Italian bathroom tiles and cinema rooms we have also installed in properties this year, they really are the cornerstone of comfortable – and luxurious – living.</p>

			<p><strong>The year of garden rooms</strong></p>
<p>Another key feature of our London refurbishment and extension projects in 2022 has been the addition of garden rooms. We returned to a property we had previously extended in Denmark Hill, South London, to further extend and refurbish the home and add a new art studio for the client, who is an illustrator.  The room looks out onto the newly landscaped terraced garden, features a green roof, and has solar panels installed to generate energy for the whole house. We also added an Accoya-clad garden room to a property we have extended this year in Herne Hill. These rooms are much-desired additions to luxury homes following the surge in working from home since the pandemic, providing light-filled, creative spaces that are ideal for separating the living and working environment – without the pain of a commute.</p>
<p><strong>The right people are paramount</strong></p>
<p>We rely on a team of experts and carefully selected partners to deliver our projects, so establishing the right people is vital for us. We welcomed Contracts Manager, Christian Pond, back to the fold this year, after a brief hiatus. With more than 20 years construction experience and a meticulous attention to detail and client care throughout the design and build process, we are happy to see Christian back where he belongs! Alongside Christian, Contracts Manager Jos Gibson joined us from a London-based development company and brings with him a degree in Architecture as well as experience of heritage, new build and refurbishment project management. Claire Jenkins came on board as our Buyer, building critical relationships with suppliers and ensuring we have all the detailed information and materials in place for our portfolio of projects.</p>
<p><strong>Looking to 2023</strong></p>
<p>With the first year of ‘normality’ after the pandemic, we have been pleased with the calibre and range of new projects we’ve taken on this year and look forward to working with like-minded architects going forwards, on luxury homes with quality that lasts.</p>
