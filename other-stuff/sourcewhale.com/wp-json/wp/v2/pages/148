Cookies are web identifiers we, and other services, transfer to your browser to allow us to recognise your browser when you visit our site. We also use data from your cookies to track when and how often pages of our Service are visited. We use this data to customise your experience with, and to generally improve, our Service. You may be able to change the preferences within your browser to limit your acceptance of cookies, but this will prevent you from using some or all features of our Service. Your browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Service does not currently support Do Not Track requests, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Service and after you leave our Service.<\/p><p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device or through our browser extension, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Service. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Service and customise your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. \u00a0<\/p><p>Our advertising partners or customers may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on or through the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren\u2019t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honour \u201cDo Not Track\u201d requests you have set using your browser or device.<\/p><p>We also automatically receive information about communications sent and received using our Service.<\/p><p>Our customers and other third parties may also provide us with Personal Information about our customers\u2019 contacts and others. For example, we may receive Personal Information and other information from our customers, email senders, databases with information relevant to profile URLs and emails submitted to our Service, and other third parties. This information may include, without limitation, contact and other information.<\/p><p>In connection with your use of the Service, we may also collect information created or provided by you, or that we otherwise receive, in connection therewith. For example, if your contacts send messages to you, we may collect and maintain the message data, which may include Personal Information.<\/p><p>We use third party analytics services in order to better understand how our users are engaging with our Service. When a user browses our website or uses the Service, these services may collect the user\u2019s IP address, browser type, and approximate location (based on the IP address). They may also set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In order to refine our understanding of user engagement, we provide these services with a user\u2019s email address (which we collected as part of the user\u2019s account registration process).<\/p><p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, data storage services, marketing services, and payment processing companies to receive and process your financial transactions for us.
