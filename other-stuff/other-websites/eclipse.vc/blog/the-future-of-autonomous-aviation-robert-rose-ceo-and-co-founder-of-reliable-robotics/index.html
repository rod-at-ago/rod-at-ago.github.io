It was 2019, and the team at </span><a href="https://reliable.co/"><span>Reliable Robotics</span></a><span> had succeeded in their first ever test flight of autonomous aviation. This milestone came after years of working with the FAA to meet an extensive set of regulatory standards. “It was a real slog to get to that point,” says </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertwrose/"><span>Robert Rose</span></a><span>, CEO and Co-founder of Reliable, “but to me it felt inevitable.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rose is no stranger to planes. You might even say that aviation is in his blood. His mother was a pilot and his father was an aircraft maintenance officer while serving in the Air Force. Both his grandfathers were pilots during the second world war. As an adult, Rose was struck by the fact that aircraft technology hadn’t changed much in the past 20 to 30 years. What’s more, even after decades, it’s still a highly manual process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This led Rose to the central question that would come to occupy his entrepreneurial career: “Why don’t aircraft fly themselves?” The opportunity, he realized, could be enormous. Autonomous aircraft have the potential to radically shift everything from optimizing the routes and delivery times of air cargo planes that ship goods and packages, to making regional and international passenger flights more efficient and accessible for everyday people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s really about what you can do with an autonomous aircraft that you cannot do with a pilot in a plane,” says Rose. “There are repositioning problems and crew rest rules that make it extremely challenging for a larger operator to realize reasonable margins in operations of an aircraft. And there’s not a lot of flexibility when you have the people tied to the physical asset. By decoupling the pilot from the plane, it enables you to move the aircraft around much more fluidly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We recently sat down with Rose to learn more about what it takes to pursue a multi-billion dollar opportunity, his top leadership lesson from his former boss Elon Musk, and much more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: Tell us more about yourself.</b></p>
<p><b>Robert:</b><span> I’m a software engineer by training. Early in my career I worked at Hewlett-Packard, then got into the video game industry. I worked at Sony PlayStation for a number of years as a graphics and game engine programmer, and then got into aerospace through an opportunity at SpaceX. I moved down to LA to lead the flight software team and they needed somebody to lead Falcon 9 flight software, so I took that opportunity on. Somewhere along the way, there was a management shakeup and I ended up being promoted to lead the whole software organization. For the last three and a half years of my time at SpaceX, I reported directly to Elon. I left for an opportunity to be part of the engineering team at Vicarious AI, which just got acquired by Intrinsic, an Alphabet-owned company. From there I went on to take an opportunity at Tesla on the Autopilot program, which was basically an assignment to get the first version out the door. At the conclusion of that project, I ended up going to Google where I led a warehousing robotics team. While I was at Google I became really interested in aviation again, something I’ve been passionate about my entire life.</span></p>

<p><b>Eclipse: What drove you to pursue autonomous aviation?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Robert:</b><span> About five years ago, there was a lot of activity in the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing community and we all thought, &#8220;Well, none of these new eVTOL planes make any sense if they&#8217;re piloted. The economics just aren&#8217;t going to work.&#8221; You don&#8217;t need to work very hard in Excel to figure out that math. We broke it down to understand the challenge. Is it a technical issue? I spent a lot of time researching this problem and realized it&#8217;s really not a technical issue—there&#8217;s nothing preventing us from automating an aircraft through all phases of flight. If we can go to a space station, we can clearly find a centerline at an airport! The problem is more the regulatory environment, and more specifically, people&#8217;s willingness to engage with a regulator on some of these really hard problems. If you&#8217;re going to automate anything in an aircraft, or put anything into an aircraft, you need to meet a very, very high level of safety standards. It&#8217;s not quite like a self-driving car where you can show after X number of miles that the system is safe. In aviation, you have to demonstrate through design, analysis and test that your system is safe up to a hundred million hours meantime between failure, or greater, depending upon the type of system. So the bar is very high and no one had yet decided to really tackle this problem until we took it on. To do so, we needed to methodically break down all of the requirements and regulations and then demonstrate to the regulating body that the system is actually safe.</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: Did you always know you wanted to be an entrepreneur? What kicked off that journey for you?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert: </b><span>I&#8217;m somebody who&#8217;s always had some kind of side thing going for most of my life. Going back to lemonade stands when I was a kid, that kind of thing. I started my own little software consulting company when I was in high school and when I was in college—on top of my job and on top of school—I would spend evenings and weekends programming, and at one point started a music recommendation company. Later in my career, I started two video game companies, one of which was marginally successful. When I got the job at SpaceX, it consumed a lot of my time, so my entrepreneurial endeavors were placed on the backburner. However, I still actively read about entrepreneurship, listened to a lot of podcasts, and studied venture capital.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: Can you tell us some lessons you learned in your early days as an entrepreneur?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert: </b><span>Reflecting on everything that I had attempted previously, and what worked and what didn&#8217;t work, and the traps that I had fallen into, one of the biggest mistakes I made was making a product just for myself that nobody else wanted to buy. That was the main problem with my music recommendation company. With my video game endeavors, it was not doing the right market research to figure out what would be a successful video game for the platform. Also, not marketing the game correctly and/or not setting up the right legal framework for the company. I reached a conclusion back then that if I&#8217;m going to start a company, it needs to meet three criteria. First, it needs to be something that leverages my previous experience, so I need to be “built” for this opportunity. The second was that it needs to be something that I can imagine myself spending the next 15 to 20 years or the rest of my career on. Finally, it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity or it&#8217;s just not worth it. I figured if I&#8217;m going to put my family and myself through the financial risk of a startup, then it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity—preferably the next-trillion-dollar-company-level opportunity. When the idea for Reliable started to formulate, it was an exercise of me trying to convince myself </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> to do this company for many months. There was a lot of writing and self reflection that happened, and a lot of research—especially on the business side. I was trying to prove that this is not a multi-billion dollar opportunity. And the problem was that every single way I kept slicing it, it seemed like I had a multi-multi-billion dollar opportunity! And, I felt like this was something I really could sink my teeth into for at least the next 15 years, and my previous experience at SpaceX/Tesla uniquely positioned me to work on this problem.</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: What excites you the most about the potential of Reliable Robotics?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert:</b><span> I believe the way that we move people and goods around the world is going to change dramatically over the next several decades, and autonomous aircraft are going to be a key part of that. When it comes to personal travel and the movement of people, I think we&#8217;re going to see massive changes in how people think about moving around cities, regionally, and between continents. People called the Boeing 747, “The plane that shrank the world,” and I think we&#8217;re about to have another massive world-shrinking event once autonomous aircraft are a reality. We also have the opportunity to impact supply chains, eCommerce, and how you purchase things. We don’t realize it, but a lot of high value goods that we purchase today move through the sky. Automated aircraft are going to enable even more products to be transported by air. I&#8217;m also very optimistic that autonomous aircraft are going to be key to unlocking electric, hybrid electric, and more efficient modes of propulsion, which will reduce the overall carbon footprint of aviation. Even with a vintage aircraft, automating it allows us to operate the engine more efficiently in the aircraft overall, so you can get single digit or low double digit performance improvements.</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: Do you have any tips for new entrepreneurs who are just starting out?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert:</b><span> It depends on the individual. I often tell people that they need to read </span><a href="https://www.venturedeals.com/"><i><span>Venture Deals</span></i></a><span>, before you talk to a VC. I think educating yourself on how that market actually works is critical. There&#8217;s also another really good book I like, </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma"><i><span>The Founder&#8217;s Dilemma</span></i></a><span>, which can help founders understand how to structure your company with your co-founders. Personally, I found that book extremely illuminating. The other thing I’d say is to spend a lot of time with the people who you intend to sell your product or service to. It can be really hard to actually make the effort to go out and do real customer exploration and discovery to figure out if your solution is actually going to meet their needs. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of friends’ companies run into issues because they were not making enough contact with their customers.</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: What’s your top fundraising tip?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert: </b><span>Talk to Eclipse, of course. Just kidding—sort of. </span><span>But I think another thing that I did right—by accident or inadvertently did correct—was that I adopted a “take every meeting” attitude. Naturally, I’m a very introverted person and I decided that to be successful at building a company, I needed to work on fixing that. If somebody had said to old Robert, &#8220;Oh, this was really interesting. You should totally talk to my buddy so and so,&#8221; I would say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if that really makes a lot of sense. They don&#8217;t sound like they really know anything about this.&#8221; Of course, that&#8217;s what I would be thinking, but now with this “take every meeting” mentality, I force myself to go talk to the person. I ended up building a pretty substantial network of folks in the Valley that understood fundraising and knew everybody that would potentially want to invest in something like what we&#8217;re building at Reliable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1350" src="https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com//wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Dec-2019-Team-Photo-172-860x573.jpg?resize=860%2C573&ssl=1" alt width="860" height="573" /></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: What kind of culture are you building at your company?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert:</b><span> We aim to foster an environment where a new employee is trusted by their peers on day one. There&#8217;s no trial period. You come in, hit the ground running, and you can make decisions. A lot of that is a tribute to our hiring process and the very, very high hiring bar we’ve set. If you can get through that process, you&#8217;re just as trusted as somebody that&#8217;s been here since the early days. One of the ways that you establish trust is by being able to freely challenge anything. So if you&#8217;re not comfortable with something or if you want to understand something, it&#8217;s okay to press the brake and ask a question. My co-founder says that nobody&#8217;s going to get in trouble for saying something; you&#8217;re going to get in trouble for </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> saying something. Peer review is immensely important. For peer review to work well, you need a transparent, open, and trust-based culture. It&#8217;s not about challenging your peers, it&#8217;s about challenging the product or questioning the status quo. People need to be capable of objectively identifying the faults in something that they were involved in creating. Not everybody can do that. A lot of people get emotionally attached to things that they built, and I don&#8217;t believe that works in aviation and it definitely doesn&#8217;t work at Reliable Robotics.</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: Your former boss, Elon Musk, has been in the news quite a bit lately. What’s the biggest leadership lesson you learned from him?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert:</b><span> Elon is really mission driven—more so than I think any other human being I&#8217;ve ever met. Maybe we take this for granted now because it&#8217;s 2022, but back in 2010 when Elon was talking about colonizing Mars, 99.99999% of the population that heard him did not take him seriously. And it is not until you spend a lot of time with him that you realize, &#8220;Oh, the guy is actually very serious about that.&#8221; And every decision that is made at SpaceX is in service of colonizing Mars. I remember reflecting on my time there after I left and thinking that there was something really special at SpaceX where every person all up and down the management chain could explain to you the mission of the company and how the work they were doing on that day, at that minute helped connect the company with the colonization of Mars. You could go down to the shop floor and you could talk to somebody who was bending tubes and you could say, &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s this tube for?&#8221; And they would say, &#8220;That&#8217;s going to go on that rocket and that rocket is then going to demonstrate that we can rendezvous multiple rockets in low earth orbit. The system will then allow us to transport the goods to Mars and eventually, will carry the people to Mars.&#8221; No matter where you were on the organizational ladder, people understood why their work was impactful. That really struck me and is something I think about almost every day at Reliable — you have to keep connecting the team to the mission. I continuously reiterate that I understand people are grinding on what may seem a little problem and that I get the frustration, but that little problem will help us get to the autonomous aircraft. So, please keep grinding on that problem.</span></p>
<p><b>Eclipse: What’s in store for the future of autonomous aviation?</b></p>
<p><b>Robert: </b><span>Speaking even longer term—and the reason the company is named Reliable Robotics—is that we have ambitions to go beyond aviation. We foresee a need in the future for highly reliable automated and autonomous systems, not just in the sky, but in ground vehicles, in medical device solutions, industrial applications, and everywhere really. I think today we&#8217;re in this wild west mode where there is a lot of low-reliability robotics, but I think over the next several decades, people are going to start to demand higher levels of reliability and safety assurance out of these systems. And we plan to be there to provide a solution. Given our experience in aviation, we&#8217;re confident we’ll be able to present solutions that are highly reliable, but also exhibit extremely complex behavior.</span></p>

It was 2019, and the team at \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://reliable.co/\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eReliable Robotics\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e had succeeded in their first ever test flight of autonomous aviation. This milestone came after years of working with the FAA to meet an extensive set of regulatory standards. “It was a real slog to get to that point,” says \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertwrose/\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eRobert Rose\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e, CEO and Co-founder of Reliable, “but to me it felt inevitable.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eRose is no stranger to planes. You might even say that aviation is in his blood. His mother was a pilot and his father was an aircraft maintenance officer while serving in the Air Force. Both his grandfathers were pilots during the second world war. As an adult, Rose was struck by the fact that aircraft technology hadn’t changed much in the past 20 to 30 years. What’s more, even after decades, it’s still a highly manual process.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eThis led Rose to the central question that would come to occupy his entrepreneurial career: “Why don’t aircraft fly themselves?” The opportunity, he realized, could be enormous. Autonomous aircraft have the potential to radically shift everything from optimizing the routes and delivery times of air cargo planes that ship goods and packages, to making regional and international passenger flights more efficient and accessible for everyday people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e“It’s really about what you can do with an autonomous aircraft that you cannot do with a pilot in a plane,” says Rose. “There are repositioning problems and crew rest rules that make it extremely challenging for a larger operator to realize reasonable margins in operations of an aircraft. And there’s not a lot of flexibility when you have the people tied to the physical asset. By decoupling the pilot from the plane, it enables you to move the aircraft around much more fluidly.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eWe recently sat down with Rose to learn more about what it takes to pursue a multi-billion dollar opportunity, his top leadership lesson from his former boss Elon Musk, and much more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Tell us more about yourself.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e I’m a software engineer by training. Early in my career I worked at Hewlett-Packard, then got into the video game industry. I worked at Sony PlayStation for a number of years as a graphics and game engine programmer, and then got into aerospace through an opportunity at SpaceX. I moved down to LA to lead the flight software team and they needed somebody to lead Falcon 9 flight software, so I took that opportunity on. Somewhere along the way, there was a management shakeup and I ended up being promoted to lead the whole software organization. For the last three and a half years of my time at SpaceX, I reported directly to Elon. I left for an opportunity to be part of the engineering team at Vicarious AI, which just got acquired by Intrinsic, an Alphabet-owned company. From there I went on to take an opportunity at Tesla on the Autopilot program, which was basically an assignment to get the first version out the door. At the conclusion of that project, I ended up going to Google where I led a warehousing robotics team. While I was at Google I became really interested in aviation again, something I’ve been passionate about my entire life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\\\"lazy\\\" decoding=\\\"async\\\" class=\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1349\\\" src=\\\"https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com//wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog-860x484.jpg?resize=860%2C484\u0026#038;ssl=1\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"860\\\" height=\\\"484\\\" srcset=\\\"https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog.jpg?resize=860%2C484\u0026amp;ssl=1 860w, https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog.jpg?resize=768%2C432\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog.jpg?resize=1536%2C864\u0026amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog.jpg?resize=1400%2C788\u0026amp;ssl=1 1400w, https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog.jpg?resize=1000%2C563\u0026amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog.jpg?w=1920\u0026amp;ssl=1 1920w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\\\" data-recalc-dims=\\\"1\\\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What drove you to pursue autonomous aviation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e About five years ago, there was a lot of activity in the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing community and we all thought, \u0026#8220;Well, none of these new eVTOL planes make any sense if they\u0026#8217;re piloted. The economics just aren\u0026#8217;t going to work.\u0026#8221; You don\u0026#8217;t need to work very hard in Excel to figure out that math. We broke it down to understand the challenge. Is it a technical issue? I spent a lot of time researching this problem and realized it\u0026#8217;s really not a technical issue—there\u0026#8217;s nothing preventing us from automating an aircraft through all phases of flight. If we can go to a space station, we can clearly find a centerline at an airport! The problem is more the regulatory environment, and more specifically, people\u0026#8217;s willingness to engage with a regulator on some of these really hard problems. If you\u0026#8217;re going to automate anything in an aircraft, or put anything into an aircraft, you need to meet a very, very high level of safety standards. It\u0026#8217;s not quite like a self-driving car where you can show after X number of miles that the system is safe. In aviation, you have to demonstrate through design, analysis and test that your system is safe up to a hundred million hours meantime between failure, or greater, depending upon the type of system. So the bar is very high and no one had yet decided to really tackle this problem until we took it on. To do so, we needed to methodically break down all of the requirements and regulations and then demonstrate to the regulating body that the system is actually safe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Did you always know you wanted to be an entrepreneur?

Going back to lemonade stands when I was a kid, that kind of thing. I started my own little software consulting company when I was in high school and when I was in college—on top of my job and on top of school—I would spend evenings and weekends programming, and at one point started a music recommendation company. Later in my career, I started two video game companies, one of which was marginally successful. When I got the job at SpaceX, it consumed a lot of my time, so my entrepreneurial endeavors were placed on the backburner. However, I still actively read about entrepreneurship, listened to a lot of podcasts, and studied venture capital.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Can you tell us some lessons you learned in your early days as an entrepreneur?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRobert: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eReflecting on everything that I had attempted previously, and what worked and what didn\u0026#8217;t work, and the traps that I had fallen into, one of the biggest mistakes I made was making a product just for myself that nobody else wanted to buy. That was the main problem with my music recommendation company. With my video game endeavors, it was not doing the right market research to figure out what would be a successful video game for the platform. Also, not marketing the game correctly and/or not setting up the right legal framework for the company. I reached a conclusion back then that if I\u0026#8217;m going to start a company, it needs to meet three criteria. First, it needs to be something that leverages my previous experience, so I need to be “built” for this opportunity. The second was that it needs to be something that I can imagine myself spending the next 15 to 20 years or the rest of my career on. Finally, it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity or it\u0026#8217;s just not worth it. I figured if I\u0026#8217;m going to put my family and myself through the financial risk of a startup, then it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity—preferably the next-trillion-dollar-company-level opportunity. When the idea for Reliable started to formulate, it was an exercise of me trying to convince myself \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003enot\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e to do this company for many months. There was a lot of writing and self reflection that happened, and a lot of research—especially on the business side. I was trying to prove that this is not a multi-billion dollar opportunity. And the problem was that every single way I kept slicing it, it seemed like I had a multi-multi-billion dollar opportunity! And, I felt like this was something I really could sink my teeth into for at least the next 15 years, and my previous experience at SpaceX/Tesla uniquely positioned me to work on this problem.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What excites you the most about the potential of Reliable Robotics?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e I believe the way that we move people and goods around the world is going to change dramatically over the next several decades, and autonomous aircraft are going to be a key part of that. When it comes to personal travel and the movement of people, I think we\u0026#8217;re going to see massive changes in how people think about moving around cities, regionally, and between continents. People called the Boeing 747, “The plane that shrank the world,” and I think we\u0026#8217;re about to have another massive world-shrinking event once autonomous aircraft are a reality. We also have the opportunity to impact supply chains, eCommerce, and how you purchase things. We don’t realize it, but a lot of high value goods that we purchase today move through the sky. Automated aircraft are going to enable even more products to be transported by air. I\u0026#8217;m also very optimistic that autonomous aircraft are going to be key to unlocking electric, hybrid electric, and more efficient modes of propulsion, which will reduce the overall carbon footprint of aviation. Even with a vintage aircraft, automating it allows us to operate the engine more efficiently in the aircraft overall, so you can get single digit or low double digit performance improvements.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Do you have any tips for new entrepreneurs who are just starting out?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e It depends on the individual.

I think educating yourself on how that market actually works is critical. There\u0026#8217;s also another really good book I like, \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma\\\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eThe Founder\u0026#8217;s Dilemma\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e, which can help founders understand how to structure your company with your co-founders. Personally, I found that book extremely illuminating. The other thing I’d say is to spend a lot of time with the people who you intend to sell your product or service to. It can be really hard to actually make the effort to go out and do real customer exploration and discovery to figure out if your solution is actually going to meet their needs. I\u0026#8217;ve seen a lot of friends’ companies run into issues because they were not making enough contact with their customers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What’s your top fundraising tip?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRobert: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eTalk to Eclipse, of course.

Naturally, I’m a very introverted person and I decided that to be successful at building a company, I needed to work on fixing that. If somebody had said to old Robert, \u0026#8220;Oh, this was really interesting. You should totally talk to my buddy so and so,\u0026#8221; I would say, \u0026#8220;I don\u0026#8217;t know if that really makes a lot of sense. They don\u0026#8217;t sound like they really know anything about this.\u0026#8221; Of course, that\u0026#8217;s what I would be thinking, but now with this “take every meeting” mentality, I force myself to go talk to the person.

Maybe we take this for granted now because it\u0026#8217;s 2022, but back in 2010 when Elon was talking about colonizing Mars, 99.99999% of the population that heard him did not take him seriously. And it is not until you spend a lot of time with him that you realize, \u0026#8220;Oh, the guy is actually very serious about that.\u0026#8221; And every decision that is made at SpaceX is in service of colonizing Mars. I remember reflecting on my time there after I left and thinking that there was something really special at SpaceX where every person all up and down the management chain could explain to you the mission of the company and how the work they were doing on that day, at that minute helped connect the company with the colonization of Mars. You could go down to the shop floor and you could talk to somebody who was bending tubes and you could say, \u0026#8220;Hey, what\u0026#8217;s this tube for?\u0026#8221; And they would say, \u0026#8220;That\u0026#8217;s going to go on that rocket and that rocket is then going to demonstrate that we can rendezvous multiple rockets in low earth orbit. The system will then allow us to transport the goods to Mars and eventually, will carry the people to Mars.\u0026#8221; No matter where you were on the organizational ladder, people understood why their work was impactful. That really struck me and is something I think about almost every day at Reliable — you have to keep connecting the team to the mission. I continuously reiterate that I understand people are grinding on what may seem a little problem and that I get the frustration, but that little problem will help us get to the autonomous aircraft. So, please keep grinding on that problem.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What’s in store for the future of autonomous aviation?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRobert: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eSpeaking even longer term—and the reason the company is named Reliable Robotics—is that we have ambitions to go beyond aviation.

I think today we\u0026#8217;re in this wild west mode where there is a lot of low-reliability robotics, but I think over the next several decades, people are going to start to demand higher levels of reliability and safety assurance out of these systems.

You might even say that aviation is in his blood. His mother was a pilot and his father was an aircraft maintenance officer while serving in the Air Force. Both his grandfathers were pilots during the second world war. As an adult, Rose was struck by the fact that aircraft technology hadn\\\\u2019t changed much in the past 20 to 30 years. What\\\\u2019s more, even after decades, it\\\\u2019s still a highly manual process.\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eThis led Rose to the central question that would come to occupy his entrepreneurial career: \\\\u201cWhy don\\\\u2019t aircraft fly themselves?\\\\u201d The opportunity, he realized, could be enormous. Autonomous aircraft have the potential to radically shift everything from optimizing the routes and delivery times of air cargo planes that ship goods and packages, to making regional and international passenger flights more efficient and accessible for everyday people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e\\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s really about what you can do with an autonomous aircraft that you cannot do with a pilot in a plane,\\\\u201d says Rose. \\\\u201cThere are repositioning problems and crew rest rules that make it extremely challenging for a larger operator to realize reasonable margins in operations of an aircraft. And there\\\\u2019s not a lot of flexibility when you have the people tied to the physical asset.

Early in my career I worked at Hewlett-Packard, then got into the video game industry. I worked at Sony PlayStation for a number of years as a graphics and game engine programmer, and then got into aerospace through an opportunity at SpaceX. I moved down to LA to lead the flight software team and they needed somebody to lead Falcon 9 flight software, so I took that opportunity on. Somewhere along the way, there was a management shakeup and I ended up being promoted to lead the whole software organization. For the last three and a half years of my time at SpaceX, I reported directly to Elon. I left for an opportunity to be part of the engineering team at Vicarious AI, which just got acquired by Intrinsic, an Alphabet-owned company. From there I went on to take an opportunity at Tesla on the Autopilot program, which was basically an assignment to get the first version out the door. At the conclusion of that project, I ended up going to Google where I led a warehousing robotics team. While I was at Google I became really interested in aviation again, something I\\\\u2019ve been passionate about my entire life.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cimg class=\\\\\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1349\\\\\\\" src=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com\\\\/\\\\/wp-content\\\\/uploads\\\\/2022\\\\/06\\\\/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog-860x484.jpg\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\"860\\\\\\\" height=\\\\\\\"484\\\\\\\"\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What drove you to pursue autonomous aviation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e About five years ago, there was a lot of activity in the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing community and we all thought, \\\\\\\"Well, none of these new eVTOL planes make any sense if they're piloted. The economics just aren't going to work.\\\\\\\" You don't need to work very hard in Excel to figure out that math. We broke it down to understand the challenge. Is it a technical issue? I spent a lot of time researching this problem and realized it's really not a technical issue\\\\u2014there's nothing preventing us from automating an aircraft through all phases of flight. If we can go to a space station, we can clearly find a centerline at an airport! The problem is more the regulatory environment, and more specifically, people's willingness to engage with a regulator on some of these really hard problems. If you're going to automate anything in an aircraft, or put anything into an aircraft, you need to meet a very, very high level of safety standards. It's not quite like a self-driving car where you can show after X number of miles that the system is safe. In aviation, you have to demonstrate through design, analysis and test that your system is safe up to a hundred million hours meantime between failure, or greater, depending upon the type of system. So the bar is very high and no one had yet decided to really tackle this problem until we took it on. To do so, we needed to methodically break down all of the requirements and regulations and then demonstrate to the regulating body that the system is actually safe.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Did you always know you wanted to be an entrepreneur?

Going back to lemonade stands when I was a kid, that kind of thing. I started my own little software consulting company when I was in high school and when I was in college\\\\u2014on top of my job and on top of school\\\\u2014I would spend evenings and weekends programming, and at one point started a music recommendation company. Later in my career, I started two video game companies, one of which was marginally successful. When I got the job at SpaceX, it consumed a lot of my time, so my entrepreneurial endeavors were placed on the backburner. However, I still actively read about entrepreneurship, listened to a lot of podcasts, and studied venture capital.\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Can you tell us some lessons you learned in your early days as an entrepreneur?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eReflecting on everything that I had attempted previously, and what worked and what didn't work, and the traps that I had fallen into, one of the biggest mistakes I made was making a product just for myself that nobody else wanted to buy. That was the main problem with my music recommendation company. With my video game endeavors, it was not doing the right market research to figure out what would be a successful video game for the platform. Also, not marketing the game correctly and\\\\/or not setting up the right legal framework for the company. I reached a conclusion back then that if I'm going to start a company, it needs to meet three criteria. First, it needs to be something that leverages my previous experience, so I need to be \\\\u201cbuilt\\\\u201d for this opportunity. The second was that it needs to be something that I can imagine myself spending the next 15 to 20 years or the rest of my career on. Finally, it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity or it's just not worth it. I figured if I'm going to put my family and myself through the financial risk of a startup, then it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity\\\\u2014preferably the next-trillion-dollar-company-level opportunity. When the idea for Reliable started to formulate, it was an exercise of me trying to convince myself \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003enot\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e to do this company for many months. There was a lot of writing and self reflection that happened, and a lot of research\\\\u2014especially on the business side. I was trying to prove that this is not a multi-billion dollar opportunity. And the problem was that every single way I kept slicing it, it seemed like I had a multi-multi-billion dollar opportunity! And, I felt like this was something I really could sink my teeth into for at least the next 15 years, and my previous experience at SpaceX\\\\/Tesla uniquely positioned me to work on this problem.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What excites you the most about the potential of Reliable Robotics?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e I believe the way that we move people and goods around the world is going to change dramatically over the next several decades, and autonomous aircraft are going to be a key part of that. When it comes to personal travel and the movement of people, I think we're going to see massive changes in how people think about moving around cities, regionally, and between continents. People called the Boeing 747, \\\\u201cThe plane that shrank the world,\\\\u201d and I think we're about to have another massive world-shrinking event once autonomous aircraft are a reality. We also have the opportunity to impact supply chains, eCommerce, and how you purchase things. We don\\\\u2019t realize it, but a lot of high value goods that we purchase today move through the sky. Automated aircraft are going to enable even more products to be transported by air. I'm also very optimistic that autonomous aircraft are going to be key to unlocking electric, hybrid electric, and more efficient modes of propulsion, which will reduce the overall carbon footprint of aviation. Even with a vintage aircraft, automating it allows us to operate the engine more efficiently in the aircraft overall, so you can get single digit or low double digit performance improvements.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Do you have any tips for new entrepreneurs who are just starting out?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e It depends on the individual.

You might even say that aviation is in his blood. His mother was a pilot and his father was an aircraft maintenance officer while serving in the Air Force. Both his grandfathers were pilots during the second world war. As an adult, Rose was struck by the fact that aircraft technology hadn\\\\u2019t changed much in the past 20 to 30 years. What\\\\u2019s more, even after decades, it\\\\u2019s still a highly manual process.\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eThis led Rose to the central question that would come to occupy his entrepreneurial career: \\\\u201cWhy don\\\\u2019t aircraft fly themselves?\\\\u201d The opportunity, he realized, could be enormous. Autonomous aircraft have the potential to radically shift everything from optimizing the routes and delivery times of air cargo planes that ship goods and packages, to making regional and international passenger flights more efficient and accessible for everyday people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e\\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s really about what you can do with an autonomous aircraft that you cannot do with a pilot in a plane,\\\\u201d says Rose. \\\\u201cThere are repositioning problems and crew rest rules that make it extremely challenging for a larger operator to realize reasonable margins in operations of an aircraft. And there\\\\u2019s not a lot of flexibility when you have the people tied to the physical asset.

Early in my career I worked at Hewlett-Packard, then got into the video game industry. I worked at Sony PlayStation for a number of years as a graphics and game engine programmer, and then got into aerospace through an opportunity at SpaceX. I moved down to LA to lead the flight software team and they needed somebody to lead Falcon 9 flight software, so I took that opportunity on. Somewhere along the way, there was a management shakeup and I ended up being promoted to lead the whole software organization. For the last three and a half years of my time at SpaceX, I reported directly to Elon. I left for an opportunity to be part of the engineering team at Vicarious AI, which just got acquired by Intrinsic, an Alphabet-owned company. From there I went on to take an opportunity at Tesla on the Autopilot program, which was basically an assignment to get the first version out the door. At the conclusion of that project, I ended up going to Google where I led a warehousing robotics team. While I was at Google I became really interested in aviation again, something I\\\\u2019ve been passionate about my entire life.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cimg class=\\\\\\\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1349\\\\\\\" src=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com\\\\/\\\\/wp-content\\\\/uploads\\\\/2022\\\\/06\\\\/2022.01.19-N927FE-208-26b-Flying-over-fog-860x484.jpg\\\\\\\" alt=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" width=\\\\\\\"860\\\\\\\" height=\\\\\\\"484\\\\\\\"\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What drove you to pursue autonomous aviation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e About five years ago, there was a lot of activity in the Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing community and we all thought, \\\\\\\"Well, none of these new eVTOL planes make any sense if they're piloted. The economics just aren't going to work.\\\\\\\" You don't need to work very hard in Excel to figure out that math. We broke it down to understand the challenge. Is it a technical issue? I spent a lot of time researching this problem and realized it's really not a technical issue\\\\u2014there's nothing preventing us from automating an aircraft through all phases of flight. If we can go to a space station, we can clearly find a centerline at an airport! The problem is more the regulatory environment, and more specifically, people's willingness to engage with a regulator on some of these really hard problems. If you're going to automate anything in an aircraft, or put anything into an aircraft, you need to meet a very, very high level of safety standards. It's not quite like a self-driving car where you can show after X number of miles that the system is safe. In aviation, you have to demonstrate through design, analysis and test that your system is safe up to a hundred million hours meantime between failure, or greater, depending upon the type of system. So the bar is very high and no one had yet decided to really tackle this problem until we took it on. To do so, we needed to methodically break down all of the requirements and regulations and then demonstrate to the regulating body that the system is actually safe.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Did you always know you wanted to be an entrepreneur?

Going back to lemonade stands when I was a kid, that kind of thing. I started my own little software consulting company when I was in high school and when I was in college\\\\u2014on top of my job and on top of school\\\\u2014I would spend evenings and weekends programming, and at one point started a music recommendation company. Later in my career, I started two video game companies, one of which was marginally successful. When I got the job at SpaceX, it consumed a lot of my time, so my entrepreneurial endeavors were placed on the backburner. However, I still actively read about entrepreneurship, listened to a lot of podcasts, and studied venture capital.\u0026nbsp;\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Can you tell us some lessons you learned in your early days as an entrepreneur?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eReflecting on everything that I had attempted previously, and what worked and what didn't work, and the traps that I had fallen into, one of the biggest mistakes I made was making a product just for myself that nobody else wanted to buy. That was the main problem with my music recommendation company. With my video game endeavors, it was not doing the right market research to figure out what would be a successful video game for the platform. Also, not marketing the game correctly and\\\\/or not setting up the right legal framework for the company. I reached a conclusion back then that if I'm going to start a company, it needs to meet three criteria. First, it needs to be something that leverages my previous experience, so I need to be \\\\u201cbuilt\\\\u201d for this opportunity. The second was that it needs to be something that I can imagine myself spending the next 15 to 20 years or the rest of my career on. Finally, it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity or it's just not worth it. I figured if I'm going to put my family and myself through the financial risk of a startup, then it needs to be a multi-billion dollar opportunity\\\\u2014preferably the next-trillion-dollar-company-level opportunity. When the idea for Reliable started to formulate, it was an exercise of me trying to convince myself \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003enot\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e to do this company for many months. There was a lot of writing and self reflection that happened, and a lot of research\\\\u2014especially on the business side. I was trying to prove that this is not a multi-billion dollar opportunity. And the problem was that every single way I kept slicing it, it seemed like I had a multi-multi-billion dollar opportunity! And, I felt like this was something I really could sink my teeth into for at least the next 15 years, and my previous experience at SpaceX\\\\/Tesla uniquely positioned me to work on this problem.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: What excites you the most about the potential of Reliable Robotics?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e I believe the way that we move people and goods around the world is going to change dramatically over the next several decades, and autonomous aircraft are going to be a key part of that. When it comes to personal travel and the movement of people, I think we're going to see massive changes in how people think about moving around cities, regionally, and between continents. People called the Boeing 747, \\\\u201cThe plane that shrank the world,\\\\u201d and I think we're about to have another massive world-shrinking event once autonomous aircraft are a reality. We also have the opportunity to impact supply chains, eCommerce, and how you purchase things. We don\\\\u2019t realize it, but a lot of high value goods that we purchase today move through the sky. Automated aircraft are going to enable even more products to be transported by air. I'm also very optimistic that autonomous aircraft are going to be key to unlocking electric, hybrid electric, and more efficient modes of propulsion, which will reduce the overall carbon footprint of aviation. Even with a vintage aircraft, automating it allows us to operate the engine more efficiently in the aircraft overall, so you can get single digit or low double digit performance improvements.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eEclipse: Do you have any tips for new entrepreneurs who are just starting out?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eRobert:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e It depends on the individual.

Personally, I found that book extremely illuminating. The other thing I\\\\u2019d say is to spend a lot of time with the people who you intend to sell your product or service to. It can be really hard to actually make the effort to go out and do real customer exploration and discovery to figure out if your solution is actually going to meet their needs.

Now, with the Ukraine war, we\u0026#8217;ve added a new issue, which is the actual supply shock and a lot of uncertainty in terms of supply chains in general. Can you start by giving your perspective on how things have changed on the supply front since we last spoke?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e The major shift I see is that in the last six months, companies and countries alike are no longer thinking of these disruptions as just something to get through until things are ”back to normal”. We’re seeing entities realize that \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003edisruption is the new normal\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e.

Supply chains always required resilience and redundancy in their designs — companies are now better quantifying and beginning to plan for the capex investment, R\u0026amp;D spend, and gross margin adjustments to mitigate these inevitable issues.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e We are seeing a couple of fascinating trends besides disruption being the new normal. By and large, the big headline is deglobalization. Post World War II to today, the world basically was focused on cost and we became very global. I think in my lifetime, there’s going to be an understanding that food supply, automotive assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, supply chain, etc., are greater and more important to national security than weapons or hypersonic missiles. If I shut down one of your supply chains, I can influence the way that an economy or society can survive. It’s like going back in time — if you cut the supply of your enemy a long time ago, that’s how you won. It’s pretty scary in some ways to think that deglobalization is happening and the pace at which it is happening.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: The last time you were here, you both spoke about deglobalization and the move to reshore critical supply lines. Are you seeing more movement on that front following the Russian invasion and the disruptions that have followed?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eIn general, if you zoom out on the war between Russia and Ukraine, the impact on the overall supply chain is not that big. I say that cautiously because there are a couple of industries — especially around semiconductor materials and the automotive space — where you had quite a lot of resources coming from Ukraine, but the reality is the overall impact is not that dramatic. We are seeing a considerable reaction, however. I think we are seeing this reaction because there is still scarcity in the market and investors and different leaders are now thinking to themselves, “If we see this movie in Taiwan, it will be a different story.” If a similar scenario happens in Taiwan, it’ll be a whole new ball game because the core aspects of the world of electrification that is driving our economy across different industries is relyant on a supply chain coming from there. So if Covid, trade wars, climate change, baby boomers retiring and leaving physical industries were all not enough, incidents like Ukraine and potentially Taiwan are all coming to create a new paradigm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e When you evaluate sector by sector, the US has many core supply chain vulnerabilities. 79% of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are actually generated elsewhere in the world. To Lior’s point about China and Taiwan, China dominates 80% of our lithium iron cell manufacturing. To put it in perspective, the US only generates 13%. When we think about these key inputs to our electronics, medical devices, automotive capabilities, and things like pharmaceuticals, it’s not to say we’re going to rush to create everything back in the US, but we certainly need to take a very solid look up and down the chain to see where we’re most vulnerable, and we need to think about generating some portion of them here at home. We’ve also lost much of our core manufacturing capacity and know-how over the last several decades. Copy-pasting raw materials extraction and manufacturing processes from overseas back at home won’t meet our needs — we need innovation to unlock the supply chain resilience we’re looking for.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Can you give us more of a sense of what you are seeing that makes you think this time action is real and on what dimensions? At some level the challenge seems insurmountable. We\u0026#8217;re so reliant on so many things. The supply chains are so complex and you can\u0026#8217;t be scared of everything or say, \u0026#8220;Mexico is a problem, China\u0026#8217;s a problem, and everything is a problem,\u0026#8221; because we\u0026#8217;re not really on a path to make our country an island. If China\u0026#8217;s been discussed for years and that didn\u0026#8217;t lead to much action to replace them out of the supply chain, what is really going to catalyze new change? Who\u0026#8217;s going to do what spending, in response to what today?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eIn 2019, China contributed 28.7% of the world’s manufacturing. As a result of globalization in the last couple of decades, it’s very hard to move manufacturing back because it’s not only the factory itself you’re moving, but the process knowledge — the actual expertise that has been built there over the course of several decades. The Infrastructure Bill that President Biden is pushing hard on is actually a pretty big catalyst. Regardless of the impact you believe this bill will have, they government is looking at each of the layers of the economy regarding energy, manufacturing, industrial, and semiconductors —\u0026nbsp;basically the pieces that contribute the most to things we almost lost as a country. The question now is how do you kickstart the change? My advice to them is that everything should be technology led versus just throwing money at the problem. Money will not solve the issues we are facing. The relationship with NATO is something I’m very encouraged to see. I do think we need Mexico big time. Mexico’s manufacturing is running at 110-120% capacity. That’s a long way to answer your question, but I think it shouldn’t be all doom and gloom —\u0026nbsp;we are seeing some signs that the government is taking some action. We’ll see how these steps will actually affect the economy or not.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAidan: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eWe work closely with our portfolio companies and hear from their end customers, so we have a decent sense of what the market is looking for and what technologies are in-demand.\u0026nbsp; We’re seeing companies become more cognisant of the costs of supply chain risks and are looking to reshore component procurement and end assemblies, especially in cases where technical innovation can enable the desired unit economics from an onshore supplier.

Can you give an overview of the things the US and other countries can do to shore up their supply lines to be more cognizant of security issues, whether it’s a war, pandemic, or something else we don’t foresee?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e One thing that’s really key is the ability to make better use of the US’ renewable energy resources. Currently, there are technical challenges to taking advantage of the US’s vast renewable energy resources (wind, solar and hydro). For example, we lack the storage capacity and life-cycle expectation of batteries that can act as infrastructure for renewables output. Nor do we have transmission or gridification that can actually get the energy where it needs to be and/or distributed in an efficient way. Government spending towards cross-country gridification, as well as more private investment in longer-duration, greater life-cycle battery chemistries are required to make use of our renewable energy resources. There are several new nickel-based battery chemistries that can expand battery life cycle expectancy to 30-40 years. And there are probably a few other pieces I touched on in that \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://eclipse.vc//blog/5-technologies-to-defend-our-supply-chain-in-uncertain-times/\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003earticle\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e that are really relevant to reducing some of these broader vulnerabilities. For example, there are new forms of agricultural technology that would enable greater agricultural resilience in the US — i.e. hydroponics and aeroponics technologies. Generally, we’re enthusiastic about vertical farming as an approach that should leverage new technologies to allow for both more productive agricultural outputs, as well as less reliance on ideal climate conditions, etc.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e Anything that at its core contributes through the world GDP by and large employs baby boomers. Most of the workers in these industries — agricultural, construction, industrial manufacturing, transportation, energy, etc. —\u0026nbsp;are in their late 50s or 60s and either have retired or on the verge of retiring. So you have less people, but as we all know, consumption is up to the right and these discrepancies are creating a massive gap. Some of that gap is being bridged by technology and automation. We also think there is an opportunity to retrain the modern blue collar workforce. I grew up growing bananas and farming then looks very different from what it looks like now. Farmers now need to know how to use sensors and automation. We are working to build companies that will be able to train and deploy modern blue collar employees in physical industries, as a result of the micro trends we have previously discussed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Let’s talk a second about timing in terms of all of these changes that are likely to happen in terms of where supply chains are sourced and bringing back some of these critical supplies and the access to them.

What I think we will see for sure over the next few years is greater activity from companies looking to diversify their supply chains away from being single-sourced overseas. As more companies better quantify their supply chain risks, we believe we’ll see a shift towards highly-innovative and increasingly price-competitive domestic

process is likely to play out. Below are a few highlights from their conversation.\\\\n\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: The last time you both \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.bridgewater.com\\\\/research-and-insights\\\\/inside-the-research-engine-two-industry-experts-take-on-the-perfect-storm-pressuring-supply-chains\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cb\u003ejoined us in October of 2021\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e, we were talking about the surge in demand and the bottlenecks that were created with ports, labor, and semiconductors. Now, with the Ukraine war, we've added a new issue, which is the actual supply shock and a lot of uncertainty in terms of supply chains in general. Can you start by giving your perspective on how things have changed on the supply front since we last spoke?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e The major shift I see is that in the last six months, companies and countries alike are no longer thinking of these disruptions as just something to get through until things are \\\\u201dback to normal\\\\u201d. We\\\\u2019re seeing entities realize that \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003edisruption is the new normal\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e. Every single company we\\\\u2019ve talked to up and down the chain from \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eOEMs\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e, to the manufacturers and logistic companies that supply them, are rethinking the vulnerabilities in their chain \\\\u2014 i.e. which components are single-sourced, where and how companies manufacture end goods, and how companies think about their labor and labor practices. Supply chains always required resilience and redundancy in their designs \\\\u2014 companies are now better quantifying and beginning to plan for the capex investment, R\u0026amp;D spend, and gross margin adjustments to mitigate these inevitable issues.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e We are seeing a couple of fascinating trends besides disruption being the new normal. By and large, the big headline is deglobalization. Post World War II to today, the world basically was focused on cost and we became very global. I think in my lifetime, there\\\\u2019s going to be an understanding that food supply, automotive assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, supply chain, etc., are greater and more important to national security than weapons or hypersonic missiles. If I shut down one of your supply chains, I can influence the way that an economy or society can survive. It\\\\u2019s like going back in time \\\\u2014 if you cut the supply of your enemy a long time ago, that\\\\u2019s how you won. It\\\\u2019s pretty scary in some ways to think that deglobalization is happening and the pace at which it is happening.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: The last time you were here, you both spoke about deglobalization and the move to reshore critical supply lines. Are you seeing more movement on that front following the Russian invasion and the disruptions that have followed?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eIn general, if you zoom out on the war between Russia and Ukraine, the impact on the overall supply chain is not that big. I say that cautiously because there are a couple of industries \\\\u2014 especially around semiconductor materials and the automotive space \\\\u2014 where you had quite a lot of resources coming from Ukraine, but the reality is the overall impact is not that dramatic. We are seeing a considerable reaction, however. I think we are seeing this reaction because there is still scarcity in the market and investors and different leaders are now thinking to themselves, \\\\u201cIf we see this movie in Taiwan, it will be a different story.\\\\u201d If a similar scenario happens in Taiwan, it\\\\u2019ll be a whole new ball game because the core aspects of the world of electrification that is driving our economy across different industries is relyant on a supply chain coming from there. So if Covid, trade wars, climate change, baby boomers retiring and leaving physical industries were all not enough, incidents like Ukraine and potentially Taiwan are all coming to create a new paradigm.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e When you evaluate sector by sector, the US has many core supply chain vulnerabilities. 79% of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are actually generated elsewhere in the world. To Lior\\\\u2019s point about China and Taiwan, China dominates 80% of our lithium iron cell manufacturing. To put it in perspective, the US only generates 13%. When we think about these key inputs to our electronics, medical devices, automotive capabilities, and things like pharmaceuticals, it\\\\u2019s not to say we\\\\u2019re going to rush to create everything back in the US, but we certainly need to take a very solid look up and down the chain to see where we\\\\u2019re most vulnerable, and we need to think about generating some portion of them here at home. We\\\\u2019ve also lost much of our core manufacturing capacity and know-how over the last several decades. Copy-pasting raw materials extraction and manufacturing processes from overseas back at home won\\\\u2019t meet our needs \\\\u2014 we need innovation to unlock the supply chain resilience we\\\\u2019re looking for.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Can you give us more of a sense of what you are seeing that makes you think this time action is real and on what dimensions? At some level the challenge seems insurmountable. We're so reliant on so many things. The supply chains are so complex and you can't be scared of everything or say, \\\\\\\"Mexico is a problem, China's a problem, and everything is a problem,\\\\\\\" because we're not really on a path to make our country an island. If China's been discussed for years and that didn't lead to much action to replace them out of the supply chain, what is really going to catalyze new change? Who's going to do what spending, in response to what today?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eIn 2019, China contributed 28.7% of the world\\\\u2019s manufacturing. As a result of globalization in the last couple of decades, it\\\\u2019s very hard to move manufacturing back because it\\\\u2019s not only the factory itself you\\\\u2019re moving, but the process knowledge \\\\u2014 the actual expertise that has been built there over the course of several decades. The Infrastructure Bill that President Biden is pushing hard on is actually a pretty big catalyst. Regardless of the impact you believe this bill will have, they government is looking at each of the layers of the economy regarding energy, manufacturing, industrial, and semiconductors \\\\u2014\u0026nbsp;basically the pieces that contribute the most to things we almost lost as a country. The question now is how do you kickstart the change? My advice to them is that everything should be technology led versus just throwing money at the problem. Money will not solve the issues we are facing. The relationship with NATO is something I\\\\u2019m very encouraged to see. I do think we need Mexico big time. Mexico\\\\u2019s manufacturing is running at 110-120% capacity. That\\\\u2019s a long way to answer your question, but I think it shouldn\\\\u2019t be all doom and gloom \\\\u2014\u0026nbsp;we are seeing some signs that the government is taking some action. We\\\\u2019ll see how these steps will actually affect the economy or not.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eWe work closely with our portfolio companies and hear from their end customers, so we have a decent sense of what the market is looking for and what technologies are in-demand.\u0026nbsp; We\\\\u2019re seeing companies become more cognisant of the costs of supply chain risks and are looking to reshore component procurement and end assemblies, especially in cases where technical innovation can enable the desired unit economics from an onshore supplier. A few examples from our portfolio: \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.brightmachines.com\\\\/\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eBright Machines\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e, which provides a software-configurable, modular manufacturing solution that meets onshore manufacturing expectations and \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.vulcanforms.com\\\\/\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eVulcanForms\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e, which provides high-accuracy, expeditious 3D printing of metal additives.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Aidan, earlier you mentioned some of the \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com\\\\/\\\\/blog\\\\/5-technologies-to-defend-our-supply-chain-in-uncertain-times\\\\/\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eUS supply vulnerabilities and you\\\\u2019ve written recently on that subject\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e outlining those areas and some potential solutions. Can you give an overview of the things the US and other countries can do to shore up their supply lines to be more cognizant of security issues, whether it\\\\u2019s a war, pandemic, or something else we don\\\\u2019t foresee?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e One thing that\\\\u2019s really key is the ability to make better use of the US\\\\u2019 renewable energy resources. Currently, there are technical challenges to taking advantage of the US\\\\u2019s vast renewable energy resources (wind, solar and hydro). For example, we lack the storage capacity and life-cycle expectation of batteries that can act as infrastructure for renewables output. Nor do we have transmission or gridification that can actually get the energy where it needs to be and\\\\/or distributed in an efficient way. Government spending towards cross-country gridification, as well as more private investment in longer-duration, greater life-cycle battery chemistries are required to make use of our renewable energy resources. There are several new nickel-based battery chemistries that can expand battery life cycle expectancy to 30-40 years. And there are probably a few other pieces I touched on in that \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com\\\\/\\\\/blog\\\\/5-technologies-to-defend-our-supply-chain-in-uncertain-times\\\\/\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003earticle\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e that are really relevant to reducing some of these broader vulnerabilities. For example, there are new forms of agricultural technology that would enable greater agricultural resilience in the US \\\\u2014 i.e. hydroponics and aeroponics technologies. Generally, we\\\\u2019re enthusiastic about vertical farming as an approach that should leverage new technologies to allow for both more productive agricultural outputs, as well as less reliance on ideal climate conditions, etc.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e Anything that at its core contributes through the world GDP by and large employs baby boomers. Most of the workers in these industries \\\\u2014 agricultural, construction, industrial manufacturing, transportation, energy, etc. \\\\u2014\u0026nbsp;are in their late 50s or 60s and either have retired or on the verge of retiring. So you have less people, but as we all know, consumption is up to the right and these discrepancies are creating a massive gap. Some of that gap is being bridged by technology and automation. We also think there is an opportunity to retrain the modern blue collar workforce. I grew up growing bananas and farming then looks very different from what it looks like now. Farmers now need to know how to use sensors and automation. We are working to build companies that will be able to train and deploy modern blue collar employees in physical industries, as a result of the micro trends we have previously discussed.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Let\\\\u2019s talk a second about timing in terms of all of these changes that are likely to happen in terms of where supply chains are sourced and bringing back some of these critical supplies and the access to them. Is this something that\\\\u2019s going to happen over the short term?

Now, with the Ukraine war, we've added a new issue, which is the actual supply shock and a lot of uncertainty in terms of supply chains in general. Can you start by giving your perspective on how things have changed on the supply front since we last spoke?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e The major shift I see is that in the last six months, companies and countries alike are no longer thinking of these disruptions as just something to get through until things are \\\\u201dback to normal\\\\u201d.

Supply chains always required resilience and redundancy in their designs \\\\u2014 companies are now better quantifying and beginning to plan for the capex investment, R\u0026amp;D spend, and gross margin adjustments to mitigate these inevitable issues.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e We are seeing a couple of fascinating trends besides disruption being the new normal. By and large, the big headline is deglobalization. Post World War II to today, the world basically was focused on cost and we became very global. I think in my lifetime, there\\\\u2019s going to be an understanding that food supply, automotive assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, supply chain, etc., are greater and more important to national security than weapons or hypersonic missiles. If I shut down one of your supply chains, I can influence the way that an economy or society can survive. It\\\\u2019s like going back in time \\\\u2014 if you cut the supply of your enemy a long time ago, that\\\\u2019s how you won. It\\\\u2019s pretty scary in some ways to think that deglobalization is happening and the pace at which it is happening.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: The last time you were here, you both spoke about deglobalization and the move to reshore critical supply lines. Are you seeing more movement on that front following the Russian invasion and the disruptions that have followed?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eIn general, if you zoom out on the war between Russia and Ukraine, the impact on the overall supply chain is not that big. I say that cautiously because there are a couple of industries \\\\u2014 especially around semiconductor materials and the automotive space \\\\u2014 where you had quite a lot of resources coming from Ukraine, but the reality is the overall impact is not that dramatic. We are seeing a considerable reaction, however. I think we are seeing this reaction because there is still scarcity in the market and investors and different leaders are now thinking to themselves, \\\\u201cIf we see this movie in Taiwan, it will be a different story.\\\\u201d If a similar scenario happens in Taiwan, it\\\\u2019ll be a whole new ball game because the core aspects of the world of electrification that is driving our economy across different industries is relyant on a supply chain coming from there. So if Covid, trade wars, climate change, baby boomers retiring and leaving physical industries were all not enough, incidents like Ukraine and potentially Taiwan are all coming to create a new paradigm.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e When you evaluate sector by sector, the US has many core supply chain vulnerabilities. 79% of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are actually generated elsewhere in the world. To Lior\\\\u2019s point about China and Taiwan, China dominates 80% of our lithium iron cell manufacturing. To put it in perspective, the US only generates 13%. When we think about these key inputs to our electronics, medical devices, automotive capabilities, and things like pharmaceuticals, it\\\\u2019s not to say we\\\\u2019re going to rush to create everything back in the US, but we certainly need to take a very solid look up and down the chain to see where we\\\\u2019re most vulnerable, and we need to think about generating some portion of them here at home. We\\\\u2019ve also lost much of our core manufacturing capacity and know-how over the last several decades. Copy-pasting raw materials extraction and manufacturing processes from overseas back at home won\\\\u2019t meet our needs \\\\u2014 we need innovation to unlock the supply chain resilience we\\\\u2019re looking for.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Can you give us more of a sense of what you are seeing that makes you think this time action is real and on what dimensions? At some level the challenge seems insurmountable. We're so reliant on so many things. The supply chains are so complex and you can't be scared of everything or say, \\\\\\\"Mexico is a problem, China's a problem, and everything is a problem,\\\\\\\" because we're not really on a path to make our country an island. If China's been discussed for years and that didn't lead to much action to replace them out of the supply chain, what is really going to catalyze new change? Who's going to do what spending, in response to what today?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eIn 2019, China contributed 28.7% of the world\\\\u2019s manufacturing. As a result of globalization in the last couple of decades, it\\\\u2019s very hard to move manufacturing back because it\\\\u2019s not only the factory itself you\\\\u2019re moving, but the process knowledge \\\\u2014 the actual expertise that has been built there over the course of several decades. The Infrastructure Bill that President Biden is pushing hard on is actually a pretty big catalyst. Regardless of the impact you believe this bill will have, they government is looking at each of the layers of the economy regarding energy, manufacturing, industrial, and semiconductors \\\\u2014\u0026nbsp;basically the pieces that contribute the most to things we almost lost as a country. The question now is how do you kickstart the change? My advice to them is that everything should be technology led versus just throwing money at the problem. Money will not solve the issues we are facing. The relationship with NATO is something I\\\\u2019m very encouraged to see. I do think we need Mexico big time. Mexico\\\\u2019s manufacturing is running at 110-120% capacity. That\\\\u2019s a long way to answer your question, but I think it shouldn\\\\u2019t be all doom and gloom \\\\u2014\u0026nbsp;we are seeing some signs that the government is taking some action. We\\\\u2019ll see how these steps will actually affect the economy or not.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eWe work closely with our portfolio companies and hear from their end customers, so we have a decent sense of what the market is looking for and what technologies are in-demand.\u0026nbsp; We\\\\u2019re seeing companies become more cognisant of the costs of supply chain risks and are looking to reshore component procurement and end assemblies, especially in cases where technical innovation can enable the desired unit economics from an onshore supplier.

Can you give an overview of the things the US and other countries can do to shore up their supply lines to be more cognizant of security issues, whether it\\\\u2019s a war, pandemic, or something else we don\\\\u2019t foresee?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e One thing that\\\\u2019s really key is the ability to make better use of the US\\\\u2019 renewable energy resources. Currently, there are technical challenges to taking advantage of the US\\\\u2019s vast renewable energy resources (wind, solar and hydro). For example, we lack the storage capacity and life-cycle expectation of batteries that can act as infrastructure for renewables output. Nor do we have transmission or gridification that can actually get the energy where it needs to be and\\\\/or distributed in an efficient way. Government spending towards cross-country gridification, as well as more private investment in longer-duration, greater life-cycle battery chemistries are required to make use of our renewable energy resources. There are several new nickel-based battery chemistries that can expand battery life cycle expectancy to 30-40 years. And there are probably a few other pieces I touched on in that \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com\\\\/\\\\/blog\\\\/5-technologies-to-defend-our-supply-chain-in-uncertain-times\\\\/\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003earticle\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e that are really relevant to reducing some of these broader vulnerabilities. For example, there are new forms of agricultural technology that would enable greater agricultural resilience in the US \\\\u2014 i.e. hydroponics and aeroponics technologies. Generally, we\\\\u2019re enthusiastic about vertical farming as an approach that should leverage new technologies to allow for both more productive agricultural outputs, as well as less reliance on ideal climate conditions, etc.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e Anything that at its core contributes through the world GDP by and large employs baby boomers. Most of the workers in these industries \\\\u2014 agricultural, construction, industrial manufacturing, transportation, energy, etc. \\\\u2014\u0026nbsp;are in their late 50s or 60s and either have retired or on the verge of retiring. So you have less people, but as we all know, consumption is up to the right and these discrepancies are creating a massive gap. Some of that gap is being bridged by technology and automation. We also think there is an opportunity to retrain the modern blue collar workforce. I grew up growing bananas and farming then looks very different from what it looks like now. Farmers now need to know how to use sensors and automation. We are working to build companies that will be able to train and deploy modern blue collar employees in physical industries, as a result of the micro trends we have previously discussed.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Let\\\\u2019s talk a second about timing in terms of all of these changes that are likely to happen in terms of where supply chains are sourced and bringing back some of these critical supplies and the access to them. Is this something that\\\\u2019s going to happen over the short term?
