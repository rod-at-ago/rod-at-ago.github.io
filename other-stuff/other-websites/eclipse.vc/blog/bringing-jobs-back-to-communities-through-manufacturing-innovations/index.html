Yet, we continue to hear stories about American factories closing, more people out of work, and small communities struggling with high unemployment.</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">On one hand, manufacturing companies say they can’t hire fast enough, while on the other, communities claim that these jobs are going away. How can both things be true?</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">If you think back to the pre-industrial age, this problem couldn’t exist. Most people didn’t “work” for an employer, they worked to survive. Whether it was farming, blacksmithing or shoemaking, individuals worked to meet their personal needs and those of their <em class="lf">local</em> community.</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">Then, during the Industrial Revolution, we saw the consolidation of work — namely, in factories. This enabled significant improvements in efficiency and led to the creation of much more complex products: the automobile, for example.</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb"><strong class="kj jl"><em class="lf">Yet, much like centralized economies, the consolidation of work has led to inefficiencies in labor supply and demand.</em></strong></p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">Currently, when a manufacturer wants to open a new factory, they search for a site, and in many cases, select a rural area that has a good supply of available workers and lower-cost real estate. This cements the local community’s dependence on this factory and ties their fates together.</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">Unfortunately, when the inevitable shift in the market decreases demand for the factory’s product and causes the business to fail — or advancements like technological innovation disrupts the industry more broadly — the local community suffers.</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">And why? Precisely because of the concentrated dependence on the factory (hence, the familiar phrase “one-factory town”). So, when manufacturing workers say there aren’t any factory jobs, it’s just that there aren’t any in their community.</p>

<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">One solution would be to massively decentralize the way we produce goods, moving from monolithic factories to small, local and flexible manufacturing centers. And that’s not some futuristic pipe dream, either. We’re seeing the next generation of manufacturing play out in new companies that leverage 3D printing, robotics, computer vision and other cutting-edge technologies to expand the realm of what’s possible.</p>
<p class="pw-post-body-paragraph kh ki jk kj b kk kl km kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le is gb">But how would micro-factories ever match the gains in efficiency of traditional manufacturing? Such small-scale operations can’t amortize the investment in components and machines needed for production over a large number of units, as manufacturers do now.

This “microfactory” is, in fact, the flagship product of a company led by Amar Hanspal, the former co-CEO and chief product officer at Autodesk. San Francisco-based <a class="au lp" href="https://www.brightmachines.com/" target="_blank">Bright Machines</a> currently has more than 30 of its micro-factories in place at 20 manufacturing sites across Asia, Europe and North America.</p>

It was the era of the ring-bound Franklin planners. After reading each book, I would write down a couple of key learnings in my planner. I wish it was a straight path of learning and later development as a leader. The reality was that, while it formed a strong foundation, it took the hard lessons of failures and mistakes as a leader to crystallize my thinking on leadership. A lot of my initial ideas turned out to be wrong. Many great leaders I had as mentors influenced my thinking more than any book.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp id=\\\"2eed\\\" class=\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\"\\\"\u003eThen, several years ago, I found my old Franklin planner in storage and all of its scribbled notes on leadership.

And yes, many of them may seem obvious. But some have subtleties in execution and deserve more explanation.

Almost every book on leadership and company mission statement includes this core idea. “We hire average employees” is said by no one. It is easy to say, “I have high standards.” Yet doing it right can be very hard, while at the same time, incredibly powerful. It is easy to be a jerk and push people and teams to arbitrary levels of performance. Great leaders know how to use this as a tool to drive breakthroughs.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp id=\\\"c3a2\\\" class=\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\"\\\"\u003eBack before the solar boom — and subsequent bust — I joined a startup focused on delivering the world’s highest efficiency solar cells. The chairman of the company was \u003ca class=\\\"au jl\\\" href=\\\"http://www.tjrodgers.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener ugc nofollow\\\"\u003eT.J. Rodgers\u003c/a\u003e.

The engineering team presented the performance of the most recent cells coming off the initial production line. For context, conventional solar cells at the time achieved about 16 percent efficiency. These cells were averaging about 18 percent. Two points might not sound like a lot, but it was a breakthrough for the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp id=\\\"17c5\\\" class=\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\"\\\"\u003eCustomers were dying to get their hands on these cells.

T.J. directed, “Greg, I want you to go to the cell tester and watch every cell that comes off the line. If the tester reads anything below 20 percent efficiency, I want you to take a f$#!$ hammer and crush the cell.” I nervously laughed, thinking that he was joking. Who would crush the best solar cells on the planet?\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp id=\\\"9a7a\\\" class=\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\"\\\"\u003eHis red face made it clear he was not joking and punctuated it with, “If any cells leave your factory below 20 percent, you’re fired.” Message received.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp id=\\\"fc5d\\\" class=\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\"\\\"\u003eThis obviously seems to fly in the face of the conventional valley wisdom to just ship an MVP and fix it down the road. Yet, T.J. understood very clearly that efficiency was our single most important value proposition. He also knew that if we accepted this level of performance and scaled production, it would be far harder down the road to keep improving. By forcing us to crush the cells, he created a very powerful internal crisis. The engineering team had no choice but to figure out how to get the last two points of efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp id=\\\"2bd9\\\" class=\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\"\\\"\u003eAnd he was right.

As we scaled over the years and solar prices started to drop rapidly from competition, this improved level of performance turned out to be the thing that allowed us to compete and win. If we were stuck back at 18 percent, the company would have died.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cblockquote class=\\\"lp lq lr\\\"\u003e\\n\u003cp id=\\\"5183\\\" class=\\\"kl km lj kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv ls kx ky kz lt lb lc ld lu lf lg lh li is gb\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\"\\\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\\\"kn jp\\\"\u003ePoor leaders pontificate about having high standards.

The engineering team presented the performance of the most recent cells coming off the initial production line. For context, conventional solar cells at the time achieved about 16 percent efficiency. These cells were averaging about 18 percent. Two points might not sound like a lot, but it was a breakthrough for the industry.\u003c\\\\/p\u003e\\\\n\u003cp id=\\\\\\\"17c5\\\\\\\" class=\\\\\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\\\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\u003eCustomers were dying to get their hands on these cells.

If the tester reads anything below 20 percent efficiency, I want you to take a f$#!$ hammer and crush the cell.\\\\u201d I nervously laughed, thinking that he was joking.

Yet, T.J. understood very clearly that efficiency was our single most important value proposition. He also knew that if we accepted this level of performance and scaled production, it would be far harder down the road to keep improving. By forcing us to crush the cells, he created a very powerful internal crisis. The engineering team had no choice but to figure out how to get the last two points of efficiency.\u003c\\\\/p\u003e\\\\n\u003cp id=\\\\\\\"2bd9\\\\\\\" class=\\\\\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\\\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\u003eAnd he was right.

As we scaled over the years and solar prices started to drop rapidly from competition, this improved level of performance turned out to be the thing that allowed us to compete and win.

The engineering team presented the performance of the most recent cells coming off the initial production line. For context, conventional solar cells at the time achieved about 16 percent efficiency. These cells were averaging about 18 percent. Two points might not sound like a lot, but it was a breakthrough for the industry.\u003c\\\\/p\u003e\\\\n\u003cp id=\\\\\\\"17c5\\\\\\\" class=\\\\\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\\\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\u003eCustomers were dying to get their hands on these cells.

T.J. directed, \\\\u201cGreg, I want you to go to the cell tester and watch every cell that comes off the line. If the tester reads anything below 20 percent efficiency, I want you to take a f$#!$ hammer and crush the cell.\\\\u201d I nervously laughed, thinking that he was joking.

Yet, T.J. understood very clearly that efficiency was our single most important value proposition. He also knew that if we accepted this level of performance and scaled production, it would be far harder down the road to keep improving. By forcing us to crush the cells, he created a very powerful internal crisis. The engineering team had no choice but to figure out how to get the last two points of efficiency.\u003c\\\\/p\u003e\\\\n\u003cp id=\\\\\\\"2bd9\\\\\\\" class=\\\\\\\"pw-post-body-paragraph kl km jo kn b ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li is gb\\\\\\\" data-selectable-paragraph=\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\u003eAnd he was right.

As we scaled over the years and solar prices started to drop rapidly from competition, this improved level of performance turned out to be the thing that allowed us to compete and win.
