<p>Once an afterthought (or not even a thought) for many, the global supply chain crisis is at the forefront of governments, retailers, and consumers’ minds, especially as we head into the holiday season. Spurred by the demand shock caused by the pandemic, our supply chain woes are not going away any time soon. If anything, Covid exposed how deeply broken the chain has been for years and the work that is ahead for the global community as we try to get back to pre-pandemic supply status.</p>
<p>Before founding <a href="../../index.html">Eclipse Ventures</a>, <a href="../../team/lior-susan/index.html"><strong>Lior Susan</strong></a> founded LabIX, a hardware investment platform for electronics manufacturer Flextronics, and <a href="../../team/aidan-madigan-curtis/index.html"><strong>Aidan Madigan-Curtis</strong></a>, now a Partner at Eclipse, was most recently an executive at Samsara and previously worked at Apple, where she helped launch the Apple Watch. Between their backgrounds and now their focus at Eclipse to bring full-stack solutions to legacy industries, Lior and Aidan have studied the intricacies of our global supply chain for years and the role technology can play in transforming it. Lior and Aidan recently spoke to the <a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/inside-the-research-engine-two-industry-experts-take-on-the-perfect-storm-pressuring-supply-chains">Bridgewater Daily Observations Podcast</a> on what is driving supply chain shortages, what it will take to solve them, and how long it will take. Below are a few highlights from their conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Bridgewater: Why don’t we start with backward-looking supply-chains? From a very top-down level, we’re seeing a massive demand shock. Looking ahead, we believe demand will stay strong and there will probably be a big desire from a lot of retailers and producers to restock inventories that are pre-COVID. How long do you think it will take for the adaptation process to take place to adjust to this new world of stronger demand and potentially higher inflation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aidan:</strong> We’re seeing different parts of the chain choke as time moves on. If you look at what’s going on all the way down to the semiconductor level, I think certain products are more likely to recover faster than others. Whether they can get these products to the shore and into consumer hands is a different question. What we’ve seen happening — and what I’ve heard from my friends still in supply chain who are connected deeply to the semiconductor state — is that a lot of the semiconductor manufacturers over the last five to seven years have been moving their manufacturing nodes from the larger, older nanometer — like 20-plus nanometer space — to manufacturing smaller and smaller nanometer semiconductors. That’s really where the investment has been and these investments are totally new ways of doing things, like laser lithography. They’re not fast to change — it’s a bit more like moving the Titanic. You’re buying equipment that costs billions of dollars and you’re retooling your whole line. So, the chance to change the semiconductor manufacturing back to having larger, older process nodes is not likely. Where you see older process nodes is in the manufacturing of components, like bigger microcontrollers or some of the components used for power circuitry. A lot of these older, larger components were used in things like automotive, where you see longer development cycles because automotive needs to be validated for decades on a road, versus a consumer iPhone that’s going to get thrown out every two years.</p>
<p>All this is to say that I think the supply chain for consumer goods — especially the higher tech ones — is likely to recover faster in terms of manufacturing capacity than stuff like automotive components or anything that goes into equipment that is a little bit older and less cutting edge.</p>
<p><strong>Lior:</strong> I’m going to take one step back. I think the world is missing a much larger conversation. This is not a supply chain issue, a semiconductor issue, or a China-US issue. I believe what we are currently facing is a once-in-a-century event — an Industrial Revolution-style situation. You have multiple-stream matters that are basically collaged together: e-commerce growth, electrification of the world (basically everything became electronics), product SKUs, macro situation — call is China-US, COVID, lack of CapEx investment in a significant way in most of the world over the last two decades. We can deal with one of those things and we can also probably deal with two. What is happening, I think, is that we are seeing the stress on the world unfolding in a very different way than what we are used to as a modern society. We are used to pressing the button on our Amazon app and expect it to show up at our door the next day. Many of us don’t think twice about how the inventory is being run, what the micro fulfillment automation is, where the cargo is that has been manufactured, if this is an autonomous or not autonomous vehicle, which algorithm on what data center and which chips are sitting inside the data centers, where this is all produced, and how many minerals you need to pull from earth in order to produce.</p>
<p>I think what we are seeing is consumerization of many, many industries that are using totally different volumes of what the world needs to consume, and that’s all sitting on shaky geopolitical ground. This thing is just a big kaboom. It sucks for the world, but it’s exciting in that it’s going to reshuffle a lot of resources and create a lot of interesting opportunities. Yes, the Infrastructure Bill is great, but when do we think we’re going to see the results of that? Decades from now? Five years from now? This is not software — it’s going to take many, many years in order to see results. Everyone is now jumping through hoops to put more capabilities on their manufacturing, trying to figure out their onshore strategy, trying to buy more lines. This is not a one-slice approach — this is many layers of cake coming together and it’s going to be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bridgewater: How do you think this is all going to play out? Where do you think the biggest shortages are going to show up across the supply chain and what does that mean in the short term?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lior:</strong> I think people are coming at this thing with an approach like, “Oh, we’re just going to put a few more lines in. That will fix it, right?” It’s not going to unfold like that. I think onshore manufacturing is real and that we will see decoupling — essentially what happened in the last three to four decades. As Western consumers, we got obsessive about paying 20 cents less on a shirt. Because of this, we don’t know how to design shirts anymore in this country. We don’t know how to do the material science or where the supply chain is coming from. We don’t even have automation around knitting to be able to produce the shirt. So, if Lululemon wanted to do domestic manufacturing, it isn’t just a discussion about moving the factory. You’re talking about cultural change, and we can’t copy what China is doing in the U.S. because we will fail.</p>
<p>The U.S. needs to implement a very different strategy and I believe that strategy needs to be technology first. We are going to deal with a new type of inventory management and people are going to source in a very different way, including retail and e-commerce. This notion of inventory and cash flow cycles are going to change significantly. That will result in a higher interest rate because we are going to use much more cash to put the product inside warehouses due to not trusting the lead time we were able to trust before. I think we will see onshore manufacturing ramp up in a significant way with a lot of that cost flying back to consumers. So, as a consumer, you will be paying more than 30 cents, but guess what, we’ll be able to manufacture it in Salt Lake City vs. Tijuana and be able to deliver it with a truck in the U.S. versus putting it on a boat for three months.</p>
<p><strong>Aidan:</strong> To answer that question from a different, more bottoms-up point of view, I think we’ll end up in a inflationary spot for quarters. If you think about where the bottlenecks are, even though there’s a 24/7 operation happening at ports, they can’t get enough trucks out. Why can’t they get enough trucks out to take inventory out of the ports? It’s because there aren’t physically enough trucks and there’s not enough drivers. What does it take to get the drivers into seats to get them both trained and classified into the commercial classifications? It takes both time and financial incentive because the people who are doing truck driving could also be doing warehousing and/or food processing. It becomes this interesting labor arbitrage game for a lot of those people and for certain aspects of the chain — like truck driving — you do need to get licensed, which is not an overnight thing.</p>
<p>I feel like we’re talking on the scale of at least quarters — if not a year or two — before some of the inflationary pressures die down that relate to some of the supply chain bottlenecks and some of the capacity that will get built out both in terms of labor, manufacturing, shipping, and processing.</p>
<p><strong>Question from Bridgewater: Do you have a sense of how much economics have shifted? Because that will certainly be an important factor on how quickly this transition will happen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lior:</strong> We faced in the last 30–40 years one thing and one thing only in my mind, which was labor arbitrage. That was the game. You go where there is low-cost labor. If I can show you a technology that takes low-cost labor out of the equation, plus move everything I said before: The design knowledge, the process knowledge, the long tail supply channel knowledge and processes, China is not better than US. I won’t need an army of people because I can have an army of robots or an automation line. A great example is Tesla and how they are building a car in a way that people are building computers. They will change the design on the fly and it’s fully automated on the body shop. They’re doing reconfig silicon, so they can use much more general purpose. On the flip side, when Ford or GM commission a line, nobody can touch the line for five years. Tesla is changing the line three times a year. So, you could do it only because there is an economical benefit. You can show the Dow rise there and the technology went into a mature phase where you can use it.</p>
<p><strong>Question from Bridgewater: As this onshoring happens in the U.S., how much of it is going to be purely U.S.? Because again, it’s not a labor question — it’s mostly infrastructure — so can it be domestic production versus shifting some of the productions from China to Mexico, Canada, or Latin America?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aidan:</strong> I’m not sure exact numbers, but in the context of industries where cybersecurity is a major risk or the reliability needs to be high, I think we’d see those move back into U.S. proper and maybe subcomponents will be sourced from cheaper sources elsewhere. Anything that’s lower value without much software technical risk, I think it would make sense for that to be more of a Mexican manufacturing base. Open question about Canada, but I think that the changing landscape from a cyber perspective means that things produced within the country will be at a premium.</p>

an afterthought (or not even a thought) for many, the global supply chain crisis is at the forefront of governments, retailers, and consumers’ minds, especially as we head into the holiday season. Spurred by the demand shock caused by the pandemic, our supply chain woes are not going away any time soon. If anything, Covid exposed how deeply broken the chain has been for years and the work that is ahead for the global community as we try to get back to pre-pandemic supply status.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eBefore founding \u003ca href=\\\"https://eclipse.vc//\\\"\u003eEclipse Ventures\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\\\"https://eclipse.vc//team/lior-susan/\\\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLior Susan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e founded LabIX, a hardware investment platform for electronics manufacturer Flextronics, and \u003ca href=\\\"https://eclipse.vc//team/aidan-madigan-curtis/\\\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAidan Madigan-Curtis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, now a Partner at Eclipse, was most recently an executive at Samsara and previously worked at Apple, where she helped launch the Apple Watch. Between their backgrounds and now their focus at Eclipse to bring full-stack solutions to legacy industries, Lior and Aidan have studied the intricacies of our global supply chain for years and the role technology can play in transforming it. Lior and Aidan recently spoke to the \u003ca href=\\\"https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/inside-the-research-engine-two-industry-experts-take-on-the-perfect-storm-pressuring-supply-chains\\\"\u003eBridgewater Daily Observations Podcast\u003c/a\u003e on what is driving supply chain shortages, what it will take to solve them, and how long it will take. Below are a few highlights from their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBridgewater: Why don’t we start with backward-looking supply-chains? From a very top-down level, we’re seeing a massive demand shock. Looking ahead, we believe demand will stay strong and there will probably be a big desire from a lot of retailers and producers to restock inventories that are pre-COVID. How long do you think it will take for the adaptation process to take place to adjust to this new world of stronger demand and potentially higher inflation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAidan:\u003c/strong\u003e We’re seeing different parts of the chain choke as time moves on. If you look at what’s going on all the way down to the semiconductor level, I think certain products are more likely to recover faster than others. Whether they can get these products to the shore and into consumer hands is a different question. What we’ve seen happening — and what I’ve heard from my friends still in supply chain who are connected deeply to the semiconductor state — is that a lot of the semiconductor manufacturers over the last five to seven years have been moving their manufacturing nodes from the larger, older nanometer — like 20-plus nanometer space — to manufacturing smaller and smaller nanometer semiconductors. That’s really where the investment has been and these investments are totally new ways of doing things, like laser lithography. They’re not fast to change — it’s a bit more like moving the Titanic. You’re buying equipment that costs billions of dollars and you’re retooling your whole line. So, the chance to change the semiconductor manufacturing back to having larger, older process nodes is not likely. Where you see older process nodes is in the manufacturing of components, like bigger microcontrollers or some of the components used for power circuitry. A lot of these older, larger components were used in things like automotive, where you see longer development cycles because automotive needs to be validated for decades on a road, versus a consumer iPhone that’s going to get thrown out every two years.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eAll this is to say that I think the supply chain for consumer goods — especially the higher tech ones — is likely to recover faster in terms of manufacturing capacity than stuff like automotive components or anything that goes into equipment that is a little bit older and less cutting edge.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLior:\u003c/strong\u003e I’m going to take one step back. I think the world is missing a much larger conversation. This is not a supply chain issue, a semiconductor issue, or a China-US issue. I believe what we are currently facing is a once-in-a-century event — an Industrial Revolution-style situation. You have multiple-stream matters that are basically collaged together: e-commerce growth, electrification of the world (basically everything became electronics), product SKUs, macro situation — call is China-US, COVID, lack of CapEx investment in a significant way in most of the world over the last two decades. We can deal with one of those things and we can also probably deal with two. What is happening, I think, is that we are seeing the stress on the world unfolding in a very different way than what we are used to as a modern society. We are used to pressing the button on our Amazon app and expect it to show up at our door the next day. Many of us don’t think twice about how the inventory is being run, what the micro fulfillment automation is, where the cargo is that has been manufactured, if this is an autonomous or not autonomous vehicle, which algorithm on what data center and which chips are sitting inside the data centers, where this is all produced, and how many minerals you need to pull from earth in order to produce.\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003eI think what we are seeing is consumerization of many, many industries that are using totally different volumes of what the world needs to consume, and that’s all sitting on shaky geopolitical ground.

That will fix it, right?” It’s not going to unfold like that. I think onshore manufacturing is real and that we will see decoupling — essentially what happened in the last three to four decades. As Western consumers, we got obsessive about paying 20 cents less on a shirt. Because of this, we don’t know how to design shirts anymore in this country. We don’t know how to do the material science or where the supply chain is coming from. We don’t even have automation around knitting to be able to produce the shirt.

If you think about where the bottlenecks are, even though there’s a 24/7 operation happening at ports, they can’t get enough trucks out. Why can’t they get enough trucks out to take inventory out of the ports? It’s because there aren’t physically enough trucks and there’s not enough drivers.

Between their backgrounds and now their focus at Eclipse to bring full-stack solutions to legacy industries, Lior and Aidan have studied the intricacies of our global supply chain for years and the role technology can play in transforming it. Lior and Aidan recently spoke to the \u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.bridgewater.com\\\\/research-and-insights\\\\/inside-the-research-engine-two-industry-experts-take-on-the-perfect-storm-pressuring-supply-chains\\\\\\\"\u003eBridgewater Daily Observations Podcast\u003c\\\\/a\u003e on what is driving supply chain shortages, what it will take to solve them, and how long it will take. Below are a few highlights from their conversation.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eBridgewater: Why don\\\\u2019t we start with backward-looking supply-chains? From a very top-down level, we\\\\u2019re seeing a massive demand shock. Looking ahead, we believe demand will stay strong and there will probably be a big desire from a lot of retailers and producers to restock inventories that are pre-COVID. How long do you think it will take for the adaptation process to take place to adjust to this new world of stronger demand and potentially higher inflation?\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e We\\\\u2019re seeing different parts of the chain choke as time moves on. If you look at what\\\\u2019s going on all the way down to the semiconductor level, I think certain products are more likely to recover faster than others. Whether they can get these products to the shore and into consumer hands is a different question. What we\\\\u2019ve seen happening \\\\u2014 and what I\\\\u2019ve heard from my friends still in supply chain who are connected deeply to the semiconductor state \\\\u2014 is that a lot of the semiconductor manufacturers over the last five to seven years have been moving their manufacturing nodes from the larger, older nanometer \\\\u2014 like 20-plus nanometer space \\\\u2014 to manufacturing smaller and smaller nanometer semiconductors. That\\\\u2019s really where the investment has been and these investments are totally new ways of doing things, like laser lithography. They\\\\u2019re not fast to change \\\\u2014 it\\\\u2019s a bit more like moving the Titanic. You\\\\u2019re buying equipment that costs billions of dollars and you\\\\u2019re retooling your whole line. So, the chance to change the semiconductor manufacturing back to having larger, older process nodes is not likely. Where you see older process nodes is in the manufacturing of components, like bigger microcontrollers or some of the components used for power circuitry. A lot of these older, larger components were used in things like automotive, where you see longer development cycles because automotive needs to be validated for decades on a road, versus a consumer iPhone that\\\\u2019s going to get thrown out every two years.\\\\n\\\\nAll this is to say that I think the supply chain for consumer goods \\\\u2014 especially the higher tech ones \\\\u2014 is likely to recover faster in terms of manufacturing capacity than stuff like automotive components or anything that goes into equipment that is a little bit older and less cutting edge.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e I\\\\u2019m going to take one step back. I think the world is missing a much larger conversation. This is not a supply chain issue, a semiconductor issue, or a China-US issue. I believe what we are currently facing is a once-in-a-century event \\\\u2014 an Industrial Revolution-style situation. You have multiple-stream matters that are basically collaged together: e-commerce growth, electrification of the world (basically everything became electronics), product SKUs, macro situation \\\\u2014 call is China-US, COVID, lack of CapEx investment in a significant way in most of the world over the last two decades. We can deal with one of those things and we can also probably deal with two. What is happening, I think, is that we are seeing the stress on the world unfolding in a very different way than what we are used to as a modern society. We are used to pressing the button on our Amazon app and expect it to show up at our door the next day. Many of us don\\\\u2019t think twice about how the inventory is being run, what the micro fulfillment automation is, where the cargo is that has been manufactured, if this is an autonomous or not autonomous vehicle, which algorithm on what data center and which chips are sitting inside the data centers, where this is all produced, and how many minerals you need to pull from earth in order to produce.\\\\n\\\\nI think what we are seeing is consumerization of many, many industries that are using totally different volumes of what the world needs to consume, and that\\\\u2019s all sitting on shaky geopolitical ground. This thing is just a big kaboom. It sucks for the world, but it\\\\u2019s exciting in that it\\\\u2019s going to reshuffle a lot of resources and create a lot of interesting opportunities. Yes, the Infrastructure Bill is great, but when do we think we\\\\u2019re going to see the results of that? Decades from now? Five years from now? This is not software \\\\u2014 it\\\\u2019s going to take many, many years in order to see results. Everyone is now jumping through hoops to put more capabilities on their manufacturing, trying to figure out their onshore strategy, trying to buy more lines. This is not a one-slice approach \\\\u2014 this is many layers of cake coming together and it\\\\u2019s going to be interesting.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eBridgewater: How do you think this is all going to play out? Where do you think the biggest shortages are going to show up across the supply chain and what does that mean in the short term?\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e I think people are coming at this thing with an approach like, \\\\u201cOh, we\\\\u2019re just going to put a few more lines in. That will fix it, right?\\\\u201d It\\\\u2019s not going to unfold like that. I think onshore manufacturing is real and that we will see decoupling \\\\u2014 essentially what happened in the last three to four decades. As Western consumers, we got obsessive about paying 20 cents less on a shirt. Because of this, we don\\\\u2019t know how to design shirts anymore in this country. We don\\\\u2019t know how to do the material science or where the supply chain is coming from. We don\\\\u2019t even have automation around knitting to be able to produce the shirt. So, if Lululemon wanted to do domestic manufacturing, it isn\\\\u2019t just a discussion about moving the factory. You\\\\u2019re talking about cultural change, and we can\\\\u2019t copy what China is doing in the U.S. because we will fail.\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S. needs to implement a very different strategy and I believe that strategy needs to be technology first. We are going to deal with a new type of inventory management and people are going to source in a very different way, including retail and e-commerce. This notion of inventory and cash flow cycles are going to change significantly. That will result in a higher interest rate because we are going to use much more cash to put the product inside warehouses due to not trusting the lead time we were able to trust before. I think we will see onshore manufacturing ramp up in a significant way with a lot of that cost flying back to consumers. So, as a consumer, you will be paying more than 30 cents, but guess what, we\\\\u2019ll be able to manufacture it in Salt Lake City vs. Tijuana and be able to deliver it with a truck in the U.S. versus putting it on a boat for three months.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e To answer that question from a different, more bottoms-up point of view, I think we\\\\u2019ll end up in a inflationary spot for quarters. If you think about where the bottlenecks are, even though there\\\\u2019s a 24\\\\/7 operation happening at ports, they can\\\\u2019t get enough trucks out. Why can\\\\u2019t they get enough trucks out to take inventory out of the ports? It\\\\u2019s because there aren\\\\u2019t physically enough trucks and there\\\\u2019s not enough drivers. What does it take to get the drivers into seats to get them both trained and classified into the commercial classifications? It takes both time and financial incentive because the people who are doing truck driving could also be doing warehousing and\\\\/or food processing. It becomes this interesting labor arbitrage game for a lot of those people and for certain aspects of the chain \\\\u2014 like truck driving \\\\u2014 you do need to get licensed, which is not an overnight thing.\\\\n\\\\nI feel like we\\\\u2019re talking on the scale of at least quarters \\\\u2014 if not a year or two \\\\u2014 before some of the inflationary pressures die down that relate to some of the supply chain bottlenecks and some of the capacity that will get built out both in terms of labor, manufacturing, shipping, and processing.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion from Bridgewater: Do you have a sense of how much economics have shifted? Because that will certainly be an important factor on how quickly this transition will happen.\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e We faced in the last 30\\\\u201340 years one thing and one thing only in my mind, which was labor arbitrage.

A great example is Tesla and how they are building a car in a way that people are building computers. They will change the design on the fly and it\\\\u2019s fully automated on the body shop.

Tesla is changing the line three times a year. So, you could do it only because there is an economical benefit. You can show the Dow rise there and the technology went into a mature phase where you can use it.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion from Bridgewater: As this onshoring happens in the U.S., how much of it is going to be purely U.S.?

Between their backgrounds and now their focus at Eclipse to bring full-stack solutions to legacy industries, Lior and Aidan have studied the intricacies of our global supply chain for years and the role technology can play in transforming it. Lior and Aidan recently spoke to the \u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.bridgewater.com\\\\/research-and-insights\\\\/inside-the-research-engine-two-industry-experts-take-on-the-perfect-storm-pressuring-supply-chains\\\\\\\"\u003eBridgewater Daily Observations Podcast\u003c\\\\/a\u003e on what is driving supply chain shortages, what it will take to solve them, and how long it will take. Below are a few highlights from their conversation.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eBridgewater: Why don\\\\u2019t we start with backward-looking supply-chains? From a very top-down level, we\\\\u2019re seeing a massive demand shock. Looking ahead, we believe demand will stay strong and there will probably be a big desire from a lot of retailers and producers to restock inventories that are pre-COVID. How long do you think it will take for the adaptation process to take place to adjust to this new world of stronger demand and potentially higher inflation?\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e We\\\\u2019re seeing different parts of the chain choke as time moves on. If you look at what\\\\u2019s going on all the way down to the semiconductor level, I think certain products are more likely to recover faster than others. Whether they can get these products to the shore and into consumer hands is a different question. What we\\\\u2019ve seen happening \\\\u2014 and what I\\\\u2019ve heard from my friends still in supply chain who are connected deeply to the semiconductor state \\\\u2014 is that a lot of the semiconductor manufacturers over the last five to seven years have been moving their manufacturing nodes from the larger, older nanometer \\\\u2014 like 20-plus nanometer space \\\\u2014 to manufacturing smaller and smaller nanometer semiconductors. That\\\\u2019s really where the investment has been and these investments are totally new ways of doing things, like laser lithography. They\\\\u2019re not fast to change \\\\u2014 it\\\\u2019s a bit more like moving the Titanic. You\\\\u2019re buying equipment that costs billions of dollars and you\\\\u2019re retooling your whole line. So, the chance to change the semiconductor manufacturing back to having larger, older process nodes is not likely. Where you see older process nodes is in the manufacturing of components, like bigger microcontrollers or some of the components used for power circuitry. A lot of these older, larger components were used in things like automotive, where you see longer development cycles because automotive needs to be validated for decades on a road, versus a consumer iPhone that\\\\u2019s going to get thrown out every two years.\\\\n\\\\nAll this is to say that I think the supply chain for consumer goods \\\\u2014 especially the higher tech ones \\\\u2014 is likely to recover faster in terms of manufacturing capacity than stuff like automotive components or anything that goes into equipment that is a little bit older and less cutting edge.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e I\\\\u2019m going to take one step back. I think the world is missing a much larger conversation. This is not a supply chain issue, a semiconductor issue, or a China-US issue. I believe what we are currently facing is a once-in-a-century event \\\\u2014 an Industrial Revolution-style situation. You have multiple-stream matters that are basically collaged together: e-commerce growth, electrification of the world (basically everything became electronics), product SKUs, macro situation \\\\u2014 call is China-US, COVID, lack of CapEx investment in a significant way in most of the world over the last two decades. We can deal with one of those things and we can also probably deal with two. What is happening, I think, is that we are seeing the stress on the world unfolding in a very different way than what we are used to as a modern society. We are used to pressing the button on our Amazon app and expect it to show up at our door the next day. Many of us don\\\\u2019t think twice about how the inventory is being run, what the micro fulfillment automation is, where the cargo is that has been manufactured, if this is an autonomous or not autonomous vehicle, which algorithm on what data center and which chips are sitting inside the data centers, where this is all produced, and how many minerals you need to pull from earth in order to produce.\\\\n\\\\nI think what we are seeing is consumerization of many, many industries that are using totally different volumes of what the world needs to consume, and that\\\\u2019s all sitting on shaky geopolitical ground. This thing is just a big kaboom. It sucks for the world, but it\\\\u2019s exciting in that it\\\\u2019s going to reshuffle a lot of resources and create a lot of interesting opportunities. Yes, the Infrastructure Bill is great, but when do we think we\\\\u2019re going to see the results of that? Decades from now? Five years from now? This is not software \\\\u2014 it\\\\u2019s going to take many, many years in order to see results. Everyone is now jumping through hoops to put more capabilities on their manufacturing, trying to figure out their onshore strategy, trying to buy more lines. This is not a one-slice approach \\\\u2014 this is many layers of cake coming together and it\\\\u2019s going to be interesting.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eBridgewater: How do you think this is all going to play out? Where do you think the biggest shortages are going to show up across the supply chain and what does that mean in the short term?\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e I think people are coming at this thing with an approach like, \\\\u201cOh, we\\\\u2019re just going to put a few more lines in. That will fix it, right?\\\\u201d It\\\\u2019s not going to unfold like that. I think onshore manufacturing is real and that we will see decoupling \\\\u2014 essentially what happened in the last three to four decades. As Western consumers, we got obsessive about paying 20 cents less on a shirt. Because of this, we don\\\\u2019t know how to design shirts anymore in this country. We don\\\\u2019t know how to do the material science or where the supply chain is coming from. We don\\\\u2019t even have automation around knitting to be able to produce the shirt. So, if Lululemon wanted to do domestic manufacturing, it isn\\\\u2019t just a discussion about moving the factory. You\\\\u2019re talking about cultural change, and we can\\\\u2019t copy what China is doing in the U.S. because we will fail.\\\\n\\\\nThe U.S. needs to implement a very different strategy and I believe that strategy needs to be technology first. We are going to deal with a new type of inventory management and people are going to source in a very different way, including retail and e-commerce. This notion of inventory and cash flow cycles are going to change significantly. That will result in a higher interest rate because we are going to use much more cash to put the product inside warehouses due to not trusting the lead time we were able to trust before. I think we will see onshore manufacturing ramp up in a significant way with a lot of that cost flying back to consumers. So, as a consumer, you will be paying more than 30 cents, but guess what, we\\\\u2019ll be able to manufacture it in Salt Lake City vs. Tijuana and be able to deliver it with a truck in the U.S. versus putting it on a boat for three months.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e To answer that question from a different, more bottoms-up point of view, I think we\\\\u2019ll end up in a inflationary spot for quarters. If you think about where the bottlenecks are, even though there\\\\u2019s a 24\\\\/7 operation happening at ports, they can\\\\u2019t get enough trucks out. Why can\\\\u2019t they get enough trucks out to take inventory out of the ports? It\\\\u2019s because there aren\\\\u2019t physically enough trucks and there\\\\u2019s not enough drivers. What does it take to get the drivers into seats to get them both trained and classified into the commercial classifications? It takes both time and financial incentive because the people who are doing truck driving could also be doing warehousing and\\\\/or food processing. It becomes this interesting labor arbitrage game for a lot of those people and for certain aspects of the chain \\\\u2014 like truck driving \\\\u2014 you do need to get licensed, which is not an overnight thing.\\\\n\\\\nI feel like we\\\\u2019re talking on the scale of at least quarters \\\\u2014 if not a year or two \\\\u2014 before some of the inflationary pressures die down that relate to some of the supply chain bottlenecks and some of the capacity that will get built out both in terms of labor, manufacturing, shipping, and processing.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion from Bridgewater: Do you have a sense of how much economics have shifted? Because that will certainly be an important factor on how quickly this transition will happen.\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e We faced in the last 30\\\\u201340 years one thing and one thing only in my mind, which was labor arbitrage. That was the game. You go where there is low-cost labor. If I can show you a technology that takes low-cost labor out of the equation, plus move everything I said before: The design knowledge, the process knowledge, the long tail supply channel knowledge and processes, China is not better than US. I won\\\\u2019t need an army of people because I can have an army of robots or an automation line. A great example is Tesla and how they are building a car in a way that people are building computers. They will change the design on the fly and it\\\\u2019s fully automated on the body shop. They\\\\u2019re doing reconfig silicon, so they can use much more general purpose. On the flip side, when Ford or GM commission a line, nobody can touch the line for five years. Tesla is changing the line three times a year. So, you could do it only because there is an economical benefit. You can show the Dow rise there and the technology went into a mature phase where you can use it.\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eQuestion from Bridgewater: As this onshoring happens in the U.S., how much of it is going to be purely U.S.? Because again, it\\\\u2019s not a labor question \\\\u2014 it\\\\u2019s mostly infrastructure \\\\u2014 so can it be domestic production versus shifting some of the productions from China to Mexico, Canada, or Latin America?\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cstrong\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e I\\\\u2019m not sure exact numbers, but in the context of industries where cybersecurity is a major risk or the reliability needs to be high, I think we\\\\u2019d see those move back into U.S. proper and maybe subcomponents will be sourced from cheaper sources elsewhere. Anything that\\\\u2019s lower value without much software technical risk, I think it would make sense for that to be more of a Mexican manufacturing base. Open question about Canada, but I think that the changing landscape from a cyber perspective means that things produced within the country will be at a premium.\\\\n\\\\n\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.bridgewater.com\\\\/research-and-insights\\\\/inside-the-research-engine-two-industry-experts-take-on-the-perfect-storm-pressuring-supply-chains\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eListen to the full conversation on Bridgewater\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cInside the Research Engine\\\\u201d\u003c\\\\/em\u003e\u003c\\\\/strong\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003chr \\\\/\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cem\u003eFollow Eclipse Ventures on \u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.linkedin.com\\\\/company\\\\/eclipse-ventures-llc\\\\/\\\\\\\"\u003eLinkedIn\u003c\\\\/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/twitter.com\\\\/EclipseVentures\\\\\\\"\u003eTwitter\u003c\\\\/a\u003e for the latest on the Industrial Evolution\u003c\\\\/em\u003e\\\",\\\"order\\\":0,\\\"get_parent\\\":{},\\\"attributes\\\":[],\\\"attributesType\\\":{\\\"content\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"raw\\\"},\\\"lock\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"object\\\"},\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"object\\\"}},\\\"dynamicContent\\\":null}]\",\"author\":{\"__typename\":\"NodeWithAuthorToUserConnectionEdge\",\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"User\",\"id\":\"dXNlcjoy\",\"name\":\"Eclipse\"}},\"link\":\"https://eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/blog/two-industry-experts-take-on-the-perfect-storm-pressuring-supply-chains/\",\"tags_67cce_bf21a\":{\"__typename\":\"PostToTagConnection\",\"nodes\":[{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"dGVybToxNw==\",\"name\":\"Digital Transformation\"},{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"dGVybTo2MQ==\",\"name\":\"Globalization\"},{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"dGVybToyNw==\",\"name\":\"Supply Chain\"},{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"dGVybToyNA==\",\"name\":\"Technology\"},{\"__typename\":\"Tag\",\"id\":\"dGVybToyMQ==\",\"name\":\"Venture Capital\"}]},\"excerpt_b28e9_bf21a\":\"\u003cp\u003eEclipse Partners Lior Susan and Aidan Madigan-Curtis recently joined Bridgewater Associates for a deep dive on the current state of our supply chains\u003c/p\u003e\\n\"},\"posts_f30bc_761b9\":{\"__typename\":\"RootQueryToPostConnection\",\"nodes\":[]},\"post_18f38_faab8\":{\"__typename\":\"Post\",\"id\":\"cG9zdDoxMDIx\",\"date\":\"2022-04-07T16:34:26\",\"title_b28e9_bf21a\":\"Understanding Reshoring and Deglobalization with Two Industry Experts\",\"uri\":\"/blog/understanding-reshoring-and-deglobalization-with-two-industry-experts/\",\"featuredImage\":{\"__typename\":\"NodeWithFeaturedImageToMediaItemConnectionEdge\",\"node\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaItem\",\"id\":\"cG9zdDoyODgw\",\"sourceUrl_772ce_bf21a\":\"https://i0.wp.com/eclipsevcprod.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Understanding-Reshoring-and-Deglobalization-with-Two-Industry-Experts-2.jpg?fit=1280%2C876\u0026ssl=1\",\"altText\":\"\",\"mediaDetails\":{\"__typename\":\"MediaDetails\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":876}}},\"content_b28e9_bf21a\":\"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eAs the global community struggles with supply chain shortages, clogged ports, and now the war in Ukraine, corporations, governments, and investors are scrambling to figure out how to stabilize and strengthen access to critical industries and resources. \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"http://eclipse.vc\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eEclipse\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e Partners \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://eclipse.vc//team/lior-susan/\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eLior Susan\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e and \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://eclipse.vc//team/aidan-madigan-curtis/\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eAidan Madigan-Curtis\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e recently joined the \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eBridgewater Daily Observations Podcast\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e to discuss the renewed push for making our critical supply chains more resilient and how this process is likely to play out.

Now, with the Ukraine war, we\u0026#8217;ve added a new issue, which is the actual supply shock and a lot of uncertainty in terms of supply chains in general. Can you start by giving your perspective on how things have changed on the supply front since we last spoke?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e The major shift I see is that in the last six months, companies and countries alike are no longer thinking of these disruptions as just something to get through until things are ”back to normal”. We’re seeing entities realize that \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003edisruption is the new normal\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e.

Supply chains always required resilience and redundancy in their designs — companies are now better quantifying and beginning to plan for the capex investment, R\u0026amp;D spend, and gross margin adjustments to mitigate these inevitable issues.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e We are seeing a couple of fascinating trends besides disruption being the new normal. By and large, the big headline is deglobalization. Post World War II to today, the world basically was focused on cost and we became very global. I think in my lifetime, there’s going to be an understanding that food supply, automotive assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, supply chain, etc., are greater and more important to national security than weapons or hypersonic missiles. If I shut down one of your supply chains, I can influence the way that an economy or society can survive. It’s like going back in time — if you cut the supply of your enemy a long time ago, that’s how you won. It’s pretty scary in some ways to think that deglobalization is happening and the pace at which it is happening.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: The last time you were here, you both spoke about deglobalization and the move to reshore critical supply lines. Are you seeing more movement on that front following the Russian invasion and the disruptions that have followed?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003eIn general, if you zoom out on the war between Russia and Ukraine, the impact on the overall supply chain is not that big. I say that cautiously because there are a couple of industries — especially around semiconductor materials and the automotive space — where you had quite a lot of resources coming from Ukraine, but the reality is the overall impact is not that dramatic. We are seeing a considerable reaction, however. I think we are seeing this reaction because there is still scarcity in the market and investors and different leaders are now thinking to themselves, “If we see this movie in Taiwan, it will be a different story.” If a similar scenario happens in Taiwan, it’ll be a whole new ball game because the core aspects of the world of electrification that is driving our economy across different industries is relyant on a supply chain coming from there. So if Covid, trade wars, climate change, baby boomers retiring and leaving physical industries were all not enough, incidents like Ukraine and potentially Taiwan are all coming to create a new paradigm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e When you evaluate sector by sector, the US has many core supply chain vulnerabilities. 79% of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are actually generated elsewhere in the world. To Lior’s point about China and Taiwan, China dominates 80% of our lithium iron cell manufacturing. To put it in perspective, the US only generates 13%. When we think about these key inputs to our electronics, medical devices, automotive capabilities, and things like pharmaceuticals, it’s not to say we’re going to rush to create everything back in the US, but we certainly need to take a very solid look up and down the chain to see where we’re most vulnerable, and we need to think about generating some portion of them here at home. We’ve also lost much of our core manufacturing capacity and know-how over the last several decades. Copy-pasting raw materials extraction and manufacturing processes from overseas back at home won’t meet our needs — we need innovation to unlock the supply chain resilience we’re looking for.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Can you give us more of a sense of what you are seeing that makes you think this time action is real and on what dimensions? At some level the challenge seems insurmountable. We\u0026#8217;re so reliant on so many things. The supply chains are so complex and you can\u0026#8217;t be scared of everything or say, \u0026#8220;Mexico is a problem, China\u0026#8217;s a problem, and everything is a problem,\u0026#8221; because we\u0026#8217;re not really on a path to make our country an island. If China\u0026#8217;s been discussed for years and that didn\u0026#8217;t lead to much action to replace them out of the supply chain, what is really going to catalyze new change?

As a result of globalization in the last couple of decades, it’s very hard to move manufacturing back because it’s not only the factory itself you’re moving, but the process knowledge — the actual expertise that has been built there over the course of several decades. The Infrastructure Bill that President Biden is pushing hard on is actually a pretty big catalyst. Regardless of the impact you believe this bill will have, they government is looking at each of the layers of the economy regarding energy, manufacturing, industrial, and semiconductors —\u0026nbsp;basically the pieces that contribute the most to things we almost lost as a country. The question now is how do you kickstart the change? My advice to them is that everything should be technology led versus just throwing money at the problem. Money will not solve the issues we are facing. The relationship with NATO is something I’m very encouraged to see. I do think we need Mexico big time. Mexico’s manufacturing is running at 110-120% capacity. That’s a long way to answer your question, but I think it shouldn’t be all doom and gloom —\u0026nbsp;we are seeing some signs that the government is taking some action.

Can you give an overview of the things the US and other countries can do to shore up their supply lines to be more cognizant of security issues, whether it’s a war, pandemic, or something else we don’t foresee?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e One thing that’s really key is the ability to make better use of the US’ renewable energy resources. Currently, there are technical challenges to taking advantage of the US’s vast renewable energy resources (wind, solar and hydro). For example, we lack the storage capacity and life-cycle expectation of batteries that can act as infrastructure for renewables output. Nor do we have transmission or gridification that can actually get the energy where it needs to be and/or distributed in an efficient way. Government spending towards cross-country gridification, as well as more private investment in longer-duration, greater life-cycle battery chemistries are required to make use of our renewable energy resources. There are several new nickel-based battery chemistries that can expand battery life cycle expectancy to 30-40 years. And there are probably a few other pieces I touched on in that \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\"https://eclipse.vc//blog/5-technologies-to-defend-our-supply-chain-in-uncertain-times/\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003earticle\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e that are really relevant to reducing some of these broader vulnerabilities. For example, there are new forms of agricultural technology that would enable greater agricultural resilience in the US — i.e. hydroponics and aeroponics technologies. Generally, we’re enthusiastic about vertical farming as an approach that should leverage new technologies to allow for both more productive agricultural outputs, as well as less reliance on ideal climate conditions, etc.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"\u003e Anything that at its core contributes through the world GDP by and large employs baby boomers. Most of the workers in these industries — agricultural, construction, industrial manufacturing, transportation, energy, etc. —\u0026nbsp;are in their late 50s or 60s and either have retired or on the verge of retiring. So you have less people, but as we all know, consumption is up to the right and these discrepancies are creating a massive gap. Some of that gap is being bridged by technology and automation. We also think there is an opportunity to retrain the modern blue collar workforce. I grew up growing bananas and farming then looks very different from what it looks like now. Farmers now need to know how to use sensors and automation. We are working to build companies that will be able to train and deploy modern blue collar employees in physical industries, as a result of the micro trends we have previously discussed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Let’s talk a second about timing in terms of all of these changes that are likely to happen in terms of where supply chains are sourced and bringing back some of these critical supplies and the access to them.

What I think we will see for sure over the next few years is greater activity from companies looking to diversify their supply chains away from being single-sourced overseas.

Now, with the Ukraine war, we've added a new issue, which is the actual supply shock and a lot of uncertainty in terms of supply chains in general. Can you start by giving your perspective on how things have changed on the supply front since we last spoke?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e The major shift I see is that in the last six months, companies and countries alike are no longer thinking of these disruptions as just something to get through until things are \\\\u201dback to normal\\\\u201d.

Supply chains always required resilience and redundancy in their designs \\\\u2014 companies are now better quantifying and beginning to plan for the capex investment, R\u0026amp;D spend, and gross margin adjustments to mitigate these inevitable issues.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e We are seeing a couple of fascinating trends besides disruption being the new normal. By and large, the big headline is deglobalization. Post World War II to today, the world basically was focused on cost and we became very global. I think in my lifetime, there\\\\u2019s going to be an understanding that food supply, automotive assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, supply chain, etc., are greater and more important to national security than weapons or hypersonic missiles. If I shut down one of your supply chains, I can influence the way that an economy or society can survive. It\\\\u2019s like going back in time \\\\u2014 if you cut the supply of your enemy a long time ago, that\\\\u2019s how you won. It\\\\u2019s pretty scary in some ways to think that deglobalization is happening and the pace at which it is happening.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: The last time you were here, you both spoke about deglobalization and the move to reshore critical supply lines. Are you seeing more movement on that front following the Russian invasion and the disruptions that have followed?\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior: \u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eIn general, if you zoom out on the war between Russia and Ukraine, the impact on the overall supply chain is not that big. I say that cautiously because there are a couple of industries \\\\u2014 especially around semiconductor materials and the automotive space \\\\u2014 where you had quite a lot of resources coming from Ukraine, but the reality is the overall impact is not that dramatic. We are seeing a considerable reaction, however. I think we are seeing this reaction because there is still scarcity in the market and investors and different leaders are now thinking to themselves, \\\\u201cIf we see this movie in Taiwan, it will be a different story.\\\\u201d If a similar scenario happens in Taiwan, it\\\\u2019ll be a whole new ball game because the core aspects of the world of electrification that is driving our economy across different industries is relyant on a supply chain coming from there. So if Covid, trade wars, climate change, baby boomers retiring and leaving physical industries were all not enough, incidents like Ukraine and potentially Taiwan are all coming to create a new paradigm.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e When you evaluate sector by sector, the US has many core supply chain vulnerabilities. 79% of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are actually generated elsewhere in the world. To Lior\\\\u2019s point about China and Taiwan, China dominates 80% of our lithium iron cell manufacturing. To put it in perspective, the US only generates 13%. When we think about these key inputs to our electronics, medical devices, automotive capabilities, and things like pharmaceuticals, it\\\\u2019s not to say we\\\\u2019re going to rush to create everything back in the US, but we certainly need to take a very solid look up and down the chain to see where we\\\\u2019re most vulnerable, and we need to think about generating some portion of them here at home. We\\\\u2019ve also lost much of our core manufacturing capacity and know-how over the last several decades. Copy-pasting raw materials extraction and manufacturing processes from overseas back at home won\\\\u2019t meet our needs \\\\u2014 we need innovation to unlock the supply chain resilience we\\\\u2019re looking for.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Can you give us more of a sense of what you are seeing that makes you think this time action is real and on what dimensions? At some level the challenge seems insurmountable. We're so reliant on so many things.

Supply chains always required resilience and redundancy in their designs \\\\u2014 companies are now better quantifying and beginning to plan for the capex investment, R\u0026amp;D spend, and gross margin adjustments to mitigate these inevitable issues.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eLior:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e We are seeing a couple of fascinating trends besides disruption being the new normal. By and large, the big headline is deglobalization. Post World War II to today, the world basically was focused on cost and we became very global. I think in my lifetime, there\\\\u2019s going to be an understanding that food supply, automotive assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, supply chain, etc., are greater and more important to national security than weapons or hypersonic missiles. If I shut down one of your supply chains, I can influence the way that an economy or society can survive. It\\\\u2019s like going back in time \\\\u2014 if you cut the supply of your enemy a long time ago, that\\\\u2019s how you won. It\\\\u2019s pretty scary in some ways to think that deglobalization is happening and the pace at which it is happening.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: The last time you were here, you both spoke about deglobalization and the move to reshore critical supply lines.

I say that cautiously because there are a couple of industries \\\\u2014 especially around semiconductor materials and the automotive space \\\\u2014 where you had quite a lot of resources coming from Ukraine, but the reality is the overall impact is not that dramatic. We are seeing a considerable reaction, however. I think we are seeing this reaction because there is still scarcity in the market and investors and different leaders are now thinking to themselves, \\\\u201cIf we see this movie in Taiwan, it will be a different story.\\\\u201d If a similar scenario happens in Taiwan, it\\\\u2019ll be a whole new ball game because the core aspects of the world of electrification that is driving our economy across different industries is relyant on a supply chain coming from there. So if Covid, trade wars, climate change, baby boomers retiring and leaving physical industries were all not enough, incidents like Ukraine and potentially Taiwan are all coming to create a new paradigm.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eAidan:\u003c\\\\/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e When you evaluate sector by sector, the US has many core supply chain vulnerabilities. 79% of our active pharmaceutical ingredients are actually generated elsewhere in the world. To Lior\\\\u2019s point about China and Taiwan, China dominates 80% of our lithium iron cell manufacturing. To put it in perspective, the US only generates 13%. When we think about these key inputs to our electronics, medical devices, automotive capabilities, and things like pharmaceuticals, it\\\\u2019s not to say we\\\\u2019re going to rush to create everything back in the US, but we certainly need to take a very solid look up and down the chain to see where we\\\\u2019re most vulnerable, and we need to think about generating some portion of them here at home. We\\\\u2019ve also lost much of our core manufacturing capacity and know-how over the last several decades. Copy-pasting raw materials extraction and manufacturing processes from overseas back at home won\\\\u2019t meet our needs \\\\u2014 we need innovation to unlock the supply chain resilience we\\\\u2019re looking for.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cb\u003eBridgewater: Can you give us more of a sense of what you are seeing that makes you think this time action is real and on what dimensions?

With the right data and technology, we can start to move away from a reliance on just-in-time or just-in-case inventory toward making what we need where and when we need it.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eA sizable percentage of the gross domestic product of many nations around the world is tied up in inventory that is sitting unused. \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eAs companies replenished their pandemic-diminished products, increases in inventories in the U.S. accounted for \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003ca href=\\\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.cnbc.com\\\\/2022\\\\/02\\\\/01\\\\/after-a-huge-year-for-growth-the-us-economy-is-about-to-slam-into-a-wall.html\\\\\\\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003e71% of the growth in GDP\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003c\\\\/a\u003e \u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003ein Q4 2021. \u003c\\\\/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eThere are vast amounts of raw materials as well as half-finished and completed products gathering dust in warehouses or in transit onboard ships, airplanes, trains or trucks.\u003c\\\\/span\u003e\\\\n\\\\n\u003cspan style=\\\\\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\\\\\"\u003eAt one time, amassing stockpiles of goods in anticipation of possible demand hikes made economic sense.
