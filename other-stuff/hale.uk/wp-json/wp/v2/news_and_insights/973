The project includes a new cinema room and kitchen and entertaining space, with a spectacular spiral wine cellar.<\/p>\n<p>In Herne Hill, we are refurbishing a semi-detached Victorian villa, in a project designed by Scenario Architecture. Included in our remit is a single storey extension with a curved hyperbolic zinc roof and a garden room home office.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile in Denmark Hill, we have returned to a property where we successfully delivered a refurbishment and new basement five years ago. We\u2019re working with Knox Bhavan Architects once again on this beautiful home to refurbish the ground floor, including installation of a new kitchen from Jack Trench. We\u2019re also building a single storey extension for use as an art studio and part of the brief for this project is to connect the building with the outdoor environment. To achieve this, a Sika Sarnafil roof will have a wildflower meadow green roof and PV panels, and we will also be landscaping the garden, with extensive excavation and Burlington Stone paving to create multi-level terraces with water features.<\/p>\n<p>Another highlight of the year has been winning a project with David Snell Architects to extend and refurbish a large, detached property on a private estate in Surrey.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been equally rewarding to hand over some fantastic work this year too, notably the 2,500 sq ft lateral apartment we refurbished in Marylebone, to a design by Hodgkinson Design.<\/p>\n<p>We began this project at the beginning of the pandemic and adapted to restrictions to ensure close, socially distanced collaboration with the client during the early stages of the project. The brief was for a New York warehouse style apartment and the refurbishment included extensive exposed brick and steel works, an oak-slatted ceiling, internal glazed steel doors and screens, concrete tiles and a fabulous lighting scheme from All Square Lighting.<\/p>\n<p>Maintaining the highest standards of project management and quality assurance remain a core commitment for our construction services, so we have brought more expertise into the team during 2021 to help us drive growth and deliver excellence across everything we do.<\/p>\n<p>Peter Woodhouse joins the company as senior contracts manager with 40 years\u2019 experience in construction and refurbishment of high-end domestic properties for private clients. Joining Hale from luxury residential specialist RW Armstrong, where he was responsible for projects up to \u00a38 million, he has also delivered a range of commercial and education projects in previous roles.<\/p>\n<p>Ian Searle-Walls has also joined us as a contracts manager, bringing his passion for contemporary design and sustainability to the team. Ian joins the company following successful completion of a multi-million pound bespoke home project in Leatherhead with his former employer Grangewood Southern. His previous experience also includes delivery of a prestigious thorough-bred stud farm, across a 330 acre site in Surrey.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Jamie Marett has also joined the Hale the team as a contracts manager. A MCIOB construction professional, he joins us from another contractor that specialises in bespoke homes and has also previously worked client-side for a residential developer.<\/p>\n<p>We have a busy pipeline in place for 2022 and a talented team ready to deliver it. We\u2019re looking forward to revealing completion images of some of the projects we\u2019ve started in 2021 and announcing new contracts.<\/p>\n\t<\/section>","protected":false},"author":2,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
