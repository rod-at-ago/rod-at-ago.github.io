Joining Hale from luxury residential specialist RW Armstrong, where he was responsible for projects up to \u00a38 million, he has also delivered a range of commercial and education projects in previous roles, alongside luxury homes. Having begun his career as a joinery and carpentry apprentice, Peter has also previously operated a small developer\/construction business and brings a keen eye for detail to Hale, along with knowledge across all construction trades.<\/p>\n<p>Ian Searle-Walls joins Hale as contract manager with responsibility for delivering high-end residential projects. With a passion for contemporary design and sustainability, Ian joins the company following successful completion of a multi-million pound bespoke home project in Leatherhead with his former employer Grangewood Southern. His previous experience also includes delivery of a prestigious thorough-bred stud farm, across a 330 acre site in Surrey. Previously a carpenter for 10 years, he is quality-driven with a collaborative approach to working with professionals across all disciplines on site.<\/p>\n<p>Peter commented: \u201cHale is at a really exciting and critical time in the company\u2019s growth, having delivered a number of stunning bespoke homes, involving a variety of architects. The company has built a reputation for outstanding quality and a construction service that prioritises the best outcome for the client and project. This is very much aligned to my approach, and I am looking forward to leveraging my experience as we continue to develop our portfolio with larger prestige contracts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ian added: \u201cHale has delivered an enviable portfolio of innovative contemporary new builds and sympathetic refurbishments, and my new role is a great opportunity to be part of a business that aims to produce the very best work possible on every project. With a number of new projects in the pipeline, there are busy times ahead and I can\u2019t wait to play a part in the next phase of Hale\u2019s expansion.\u201d<\/p>\n\t<\/section>","protected":false},"author":2,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
