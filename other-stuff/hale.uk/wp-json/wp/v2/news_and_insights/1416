It was our first project collaborating with award-winning architects Holland Green Architecture and deepens our experience in the luxury homes sector. From foundations and hard landscaping to final fix, we managed the entire 52-week programme and have delivered an outstanding home which is creating an impact in the luxury homes sector.<\/p>\n<p>The high-end design mixes traditional forms and materials with contemporary flair. A steel frame facilitates three floors of accommodation and extensive glazing to maximise the light and space across 6,000 square feet.<\/p>\n<p>We built the property using Randers Tegl Ultima bricks for an outstanding contemporary impact across the entire exterior. Only 38mm high but twice as long as standard, each brick had to be laid with particular care, using carefully selected coloured mortar from Tarmac, to complement the grey tones of the bricks. The huge sections of glazing were logistically and technically complex to install, but the effect is stunning. With no supporting bars, the family can enjoy uninterrupted garden views.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image indent\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1732\" height=\"1028\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/gardenway13-1732x1028.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1732xX size-1732xX\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t\n\n\t<section class=\"news-text\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p>We installed large roof lights on the pitched roof, along with an 8kW solar array to further capitalise on sunlight all year round. The wraparound terrace will come into its own during the summer months as the family enjoys outdoor-indoor living.<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<p>The owners wanted to avoid traditional fuels, so alongside the solar panels, we fitted a 12kW Air Source Heat Pump. This not only provides hot water and underfloor heating, but chilled water for the air conditioning system too.<\/p>\n<p>A mechanical heat recovery ventilation system was added for even greater comfort and air circulation. Overall, we established an airtight building envelope to ensure the best performance and thermal efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>We also connected storage batteries to the solar panels to power the family\u2019s electric vehicles and lower their demands on the electricity grid. Alongside the contemporary energy system, we installed a complex electrical scheme with integrated smart technology to manage security, lighting, entertainment and heating.<\/p>\n<p>The impressive, triple-height entrance hallway to the property features a floating steel and smoked oak staircase with glass balustrades and LED tread lights and is topped with an exquisite light fixture of multiple individual hanging pieces. The herringbone smoked oak engineered flooring from Ted Todd runs throughout the ground floor.<\/p>\n<p>The success of the light-filled space and interior design of the home hinges on clean lines, a minimal palette of materials and the impeccable finish we implemented. Fine details such as concealed gutters, glass balustrades, elegant bathrooms and the custom-built Neatsmith dressing room add to the overall impression of simplicity and quiet luxury.<\/p>\n<p>Christian Hale, Managing Director of Hale, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed working with HollandGreen. Our companies share a collaborative and proactive ethos over design and construction, which has culminated in us producing an exceptional home in every way. The project showcases our ability to deliver unique homes to a very high standard and manage a complex programme. A design like this demands genuine care and attention. The skill, quality and meticulous detail we\u2019ve poured into this project has made it the success it is. I\u2019m so proud of the team\u2019s enthusiasm, dedication and achievements in bringing this family\u2019s dream home to life.\u201d<\/p>\n\t<\/section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"news-image full\" data-colour=\"light\">\n\t\t<figure><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/gardenway12-1920x1080.jpg\" class=\"attachment-1920x1080 size-1920x1080\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/gardenway12-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/hale.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/gardenway12-124x71.jpg 124w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/figure>\n\t<\/section>\n\t","protected":false},"author":2,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.13 -
